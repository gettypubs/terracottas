      "condition": "The musical instrument and the middle finger of the left hand are missing. The figure was reassembled from a number of fragments prior to its acquisition by the J. Paul Getty Museum. The legs, the head, and several sections of the himation were reattached. Missing sections were filled in, especially on the chair in the area of the backrest and the rear portion of the torso. During this interval, for which no specific documentation exists, it is likely that invasive cleaning also damaged some of the ancient polychromy. Recent investigations have helped clarify that the obscuring encrustations were probably added at this time, especially on the body and the head, in order to conceal break lines and areas of fill, and to give the figure a more uniform appearance overall. The interior of the statue was also widely consolidated and reinforced with an added material, except in several sections where the clay is still visible. As a result, there are only a few places where the original marks of the modeling and the fingerprints of the coroplast can be observed. In 1983, exploratory cleaning on a limited portion of the footstool and chair was performed by the Getty’s Antiquities Conservation Department, revealing some of the original polychromy and the presence of footprints on the upper surface of the footstool.\n",

      "description": "\nThe male figure is shown sitting on a *klismos* (seat). The seat, with a broad, rounded backrest, is set on a low rectangular platform composed of two distinct sections. The first section has a concave outer edge and is an integral part of the chair, serving as its base; the second section is composed of a movable element with a convex edge that fits flush and snug against the first section. The rectangular openings on either side of the chair may have been used either to lift the figure or to provide ventilation during firing.\n\nThe body is wrapped in a mantle that covers his left shoulder and part of his left arm, leaving his chest bare and showing wrinkles around the navel and the armpit. The mantle drops on either side with deep folds, covering the figure’s legs to the calves. The legs are slightly spread,\nso that the clay of the garment forms thin, deep folds. The right foot rests on the footstool, while only the tip of the left foot touches it. The figure is wearing flat sandals with thongs that cross on the top of the feet. The footstool is made of a rectangular slab with moldings and two lateral elements with a rounded shape, terminating in four corbels.\n\nThe figure’s head is erect and turned toward the right. The face is rounded; the mouth, with its fleshy, carefully modeled lips, is partially open, revealing the upper dental arch; a dimple marks the point where the lower lip meets the prominent chin. The curling of the lower lip and the half-open mouth are both signs that this character was probably portrayed in the act of singing. The nose is straight, the nostrils are rounded, and the almond-shaped eyes have distinctly portrayed eyelids, with clearly depicted tear glands. The supraorbital arch, broad and close to the eye, runs directly into the upper part of the nose. The hair must have been painted, as was determined by a careful analysis of the nape of the neck, but it is possible that the head was partially covered by a headdress, as the modeling of the upper part of the forehead seems to suggest. The ears are well modeled.\n\nThe right arm, its elbow resting against the torso, is bent, reaching forward to hold a plectrum, while the left hand was probably plucking the strings of a kithara*.* A trace of the instrument survives in the concavity where it must have rested on the left leg.\n"

She is resting her long, slender\nlegs, which terminate in four long talons, atop a rounded, rocky base\nmarked by a series of protuberances. The upper part of her body is human\nin appearance: the right arm is folded beneath the breasts and the left\nhand is propped under the chin. The head is slightly tilted to the left,\nin keeping with an iconographic scheme generally employed to express\ngrief or sadness. The features of the face resemble those of Orpheus.\nThe face is full and round, with a prominent chin. The neck is short,\nmarked by the “rings of Venus.” The eyes are asymmetrical, with the\nupper eyelid more pronounced and the arched eyebrows situated close to\nthe eyelids. The nose is straight, with a rounded tip. The lips are\nfleshy and well designed. The face is framed by a hairstyle\ncharacterized by a series of roughly modeled, short, twisting curls\napplied to the top of the head and partially covering the ears. The\nfigure is dressed in a short chiton with an *apoptygma* (capelike fold)\nthat clings to her body, forming pleats that are flattened on the front,\nwhile on the sides they open out as if they were tossing in the wind,\nwith beautifully hand-modeled ruffles. A sash is wrapped high around the\nchest, with two shoulder straps crossing over the bust. In the back, the\ndrapery extends to form a broad, tubular tail, flared toward the end\nlike a fan. This tail also helped to balance the statue. In the back of\nthe figure, the crossing shoulder straps cannot be seen.\n"

The low\nforehead is framed by a hairstyle made up of large locks of densely\nstriated hair, parted in the middle and arranged around the two sides of\nthe forehead, covering the upper parts of the ears. The asymmetrical\neyes are globular, with marked irises. The slightly lowered eyelids are\nthick, with a well-defined silhouette. The nose is short, and the mouth,\ntightly closed, has fleshy lips with clear outlines. The chin has a\ndimple that also defines the connection between the lower lip and the\nchin.\n\nThe head, probably dating to the end of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> presents the usual formal\nfeatures of Severe-style sculpture, such as the heavy jaw and the\nhairstyle with broad distinct locks of hair arranged over the forehead\nand combed in a roll just suggested behind the nape of the neck. The\nsame distinctive linear style appears in many other Severe-style works\nfrom Sicily and Magna Graecia dating from the fifth century to the first\nhalf of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^1] In sculpture, this type\nof hairstyle is reminiscent of the figure of Actaeon in the metope of\nthe Temple E at Selinunte, the marble ephebe from Agrigento, and the\nbronze ephebe of Selinunte from 470 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, and it is also comparable in\nthe Attic context to the Ephebe attributable to Kritios from Athens.[^2]\nIn small statuary, the tightly rolled puff at the nape of the neck,\npresent also on female heads (see [cat. 9](9) and [10](10)), can be found in\nnumerous small bronzes and, with an especially calligraphic rendering,\nis very common in various coroplastic types of the Severe style.[^3] The\nevolution of hairstyles can also be traced in coins of Southern Italy\nand Sicily from the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^4]\n\n[^1]: For the rendering of the facial features, in particular for the\n    chin and pronounced jaw, see the head of a banqueter dating to the\n    end of the fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Herdejürger</span> 1982, no. 101,\n    p. 41, and the head of a female figure dating to the beginning of\n    the fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>\n    in <span class=\"smcaps\">Iacobone</span> 1988, pl.\n    72a, p. 79.

      "description": "\nThe male head is set on a thick, strong neck and is slightly tilted\ntoward the left. The face is full, the forehead is high, the eyes are\nsmall, set close together, and sunken, with the outer corner downturned;\nthe eyelids are thick and the superciliary arches are marked. The nose\nis short and compressed, the mouth is small and tight, with fleshy lips\nand an undulating line; the rounded chin has a hint of a double chin.\nThe head is framed by a dense thatch of hair with short, vibrant curls\nheld by a tubular band. The back of the head protrudes, and the hair is\nfinished in an increasingly irregular and summary manner toward the\ncenter of the head. There is a circular hole on the nape of the neck.\n\nThe hairstyle of this head, with its curly, short locks, can be seen on\nvarious types of statues from the Early Hellenistic period. Combined\nwith the distinctive rendering of facial features, it appears to be, if\nnot a full-fledged portrait, at least a strongly characterized depiction\nof a man.[^1]\n\nThe type is attested in Tarentine coroplastic art of the Early\nHellenistic period and is comparable to a number of heads of banqueters\nin the collection of the Musei Civici di Trieste; to a statuette that\nforms part of a group of banqueters in a Swiss collection; and to an\nantefix similar to the Getty head in the broad structure of the\nface.[^2] The leonine hairstyle with erect wisps recalls portraits of\nAlexander, which were popular in Magna Graecia, not only in Taranto but\nalso in such southern Italian centers as Fratte di Salerno, Capua,\nTeano, and Calvi, and in central Italy.[^3] In particular, the short\ncurls are reminiscent of those on a male head that formed part of the\ndecoration of the temple at the sanctuary of Lo Scasato at Falerii,\ndating to the beginning of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, in which Italiote and\npossibly Tarentine components have been identified.[^4] The treatment of\nthe locks also seems to reflect a Skopasian influence in the context of\nthe stylistic eclecticism that was characteristic of the Tarentine\ncoroplastic production.[^5] The fine locks of curly hair and the type of\ntubular ribbon that gathers the hair can also be found in heads of\nathletes.[^6] On the basis of established comparisons, the Getty head\ncan be dated to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^1]: The portrait value of a number of terracotta heads from the second\n    half of the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> has been analyzed, as\n    regards the central Italic area, by Steingräber who sees in them\n    well characterized types instead of genuine physiognomic likenesses:\n    S.

      "description": "\nThe young man’s head is set on a bull neck. The face is squarish, the\nfacial features are marked, the cheeks are full, the eyes are large and\nasymmetrical, the nose is broad, and the mouth, with its sharply drawn\nand fleshy lips, is half-open. The curly hair is rendered rather\ncarelessly in small clumps arranged in an arc across the forehead,\nleaving the large ears uncovered; the ears are characterized by swollen\nauricles. On the nape of the neck and on the occiput, the hair is left\nunfinished.\n\nGiven the tight, snug head of hair and the mouth with fleshy lips, this\ntype might well depict an African, but the large ears are reminiscent of\nan athlete and, more specifically, a boxer, since such ears were\nconsidered characteristic of those who practiced this sport. Sports\nenjoyed a long tradition in Taras and, together with Metapontion\n(Metaponto) and Lokris, the Laconian colony had won numerous victories\nat Olympia. As a result of the ties established between athleticism and\nthe philosophical culture of Magna Graecia, images of athletes and\nathletic contests had become preferred iconographic motifs in\nvase-painting as far back as the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^1]\n\nThe image of an athlete within a cult precinct that may have belonged to\nthe necropolis, as for example at Satyrion, might be a reference to the\nsocial and political function attributed to the offerer or the deceased.\n\nThe childish appearance of this face and a number of formal elements\nhark back to the heads of young athletes in the Severe style, such as a\nmarble head from the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, a Roman copy after a\nSevere-style prototype with close-cut hair, large eyes with thick\neyelids, and the heavy overall structure.[^2] A marble male head from\nTaranto, datable to the end of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and probably of the local\nschool, though influenced by Attic production, presents similar\ncharacteristics in the fleshy face and the hair rendered in globular\nclumps on the sides; the shape of the thick eyelids and the full face,\nreminiscent of the Getty head, are characteristics found in other\nTarentine heads from the Early Hellenistic period.[^3]\n\n[^1]: For sports in Magna Graecia and boxing in particular, see L.\n    Masiello, “Le specialità agonistiche: Il pugilato,” in *Atleti e\n    guerrieri: Tradizioni aristocratiche a Taranto tra VI e V secolo\n    a.C.*, exh. cat.

The back portion of the head shows\nhasty, summary modeling; the wreath and hair were applied separately\nbefore the firing. A circular opening can be seen in the back of the\nneck.\n\nThe face is round and full, the eyes have thickened eyelids that are\nasymmetrical and irregular in shape; the mouth, barely half-open, has\nfleshy lips. The hair is parted in a “pincer” style over the forehead\nand arranged around the face with lively locks defined by fine\nstriations. The head must once have had a headdress with bands that fell\non either side of the face and a wreath: a distinctive element in the\ntypology of banqueters to which this head is linked. A number of heads\nof statuettes of banqueters from Taranto wear wreaths with rosettes\ntopped by a complicated floral *fastigium* (crown).[^1] The most\ndistinctive element is the hairstyle, in which it is possible to\nrecognize a Polykleitan influence that extended in Taras even beyond the\nfifth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2] The\nhead, larger than other comparable heads (which generally belong to\nmedium-sized statuettes), presents a nesting system by means of which it\nwas inserted into the body of the statue, a technique not unusual in\ncoroplastic workshops.[^3]\n\n[^1]: There are numerous comparisons with statuettes of varying sizes\n    from the Tarentine context, for example: <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Iacobone</span> 1988, pp. 95–96,\n    pl. 90a–b, head and bust of banqueters from the votive deposits of\n    the Via di Palma and of Contrada Corti Vecchie, datable to the first\n    half of the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; the statuette from the\n    votive deposit of the Via di Palma, inv. 200354 in the Museo\n    Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto; and the piece in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Caporusso</span> 1975, no. 14, pl.\n    IX, from the end of the fifth to the beginning of the fourth century\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> Dating to the same\n    period is a head with traces of red color on the hair; see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Leyenaar-Plaisier</span> 1979, vol.\n    1, no. 155, pl. 27; <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Breitenstein</span> 1941, p. 17,\n    no. 10; <span class=\"smcaps\">Herdejürgen</span>\n    1971, no. 25, fig. 9; <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Levi</span> 1926, fig. 38, no. 141;\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Bartoccini</span> 1936, fig.\n    56, p. 158 (head of a banqueter with the same arrangement of locks\n    of hair from a votive deposit in Contrada Corti Vecchie); the head\n    from the Fondo Giovinazzi in Taranto, from the late fourth century\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Higgins</span> 1954, pl. 176, nos.\n    1284–85; and the unpublished piece now in the Musei Civici di\n    Trieste, <span class=\"smcaps\">Poli</span> 2010,\n    cat. 376, p. 241, from the end of the fifth to the beginning of the\n    fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> See\n    also the Metapontine head in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Letta</span> 1971, pl.

The figure wears ornamental\nheadgear added to the head and decorated with ribbon, a wreath, probably\nthree rosettes, and bands falling on either side of the face and onto\nthe shoulders. The hair protrudes from beneath the head covering and,\nleaving the ears uncovered, is arrayed on either side of the face in\nwavy locks, clearly separated by incisions.

The head can\nbe assigned to the type of the young, beardless banqueter represented in\nthe act of singing, found in Tarentine production from the end of the\nfifth and the first half of the fourth centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^1] The wreath decorated\nwith three symmetrically arranged rosettes and sometimes topped by a\nsmall palm tree is distinctive to the Tarentine area and can also be\nfound in a number of bronzes that are probably depictions of Zeus\nKatabaites.[^2] The details of the fine locks of hair, the half-open\nmouth, and the tilted position of the head are also found in a number of\nbusts and terracotta sculptures from Taranto.[^3] Music and song\nconstituted significant moments during the symposium, and these\niconographic elements, much like the individual attributes accompanying\nthe depictions of the banqueters, must have had a specific value in\nvarious phases of the ritual, related to status and age, which\nidentified the banqueter in the context of the political and social\ncommunity.[^4]\n\n[^1]: On the type of the reclining figure in general, see the\n    introduction and [cat. 6](6).

      "description": "\nThe head is set on a powerful neck that is slightly tapered and marked\nby two Venus rings. The face is oval; the forehead is high; the eyes are\nasymmetrical, set on two different planes, and slightly sunken. The\neyelids are thick and the outer corners are twisted downward. The lips\nare fleshy, the chin is full and rounded with a dimple at the beginning\nof the lower lip; the nose is straight with a flattened ridge. The hair,\nparted in the middle, is arranged in long, parallel, serpentine locks\nwith sharp ridges; it puffs out on either side of the face and is\ngathered in a roll behind the neck, leaving the earlobes uncovered. In\nthe middle of the hair is a flattened triangular space, suggesting that\na diadem may have been inserted there. On the nape of the neck, the hair\nis depicted with wavy, parallel incisions. The ears are pierced for the\ninsertion of earrings. The chin is quite pronounced. On the left side of\nthe nape of the neck, there is a small hole.[^1]\n\nThe head shows considerable stylistic and iconographic affinities with\nthe head at [cat. 10](10), especially in the rendering of the hairstyle and\nthe general treatment of the facial features, though the workmanship is\nless precise and the hair shows a looser style in front. Like the\nprevious head, this type can be compared with the Sicilian busts which\nin Magna Graecia were modified in keeping with local stylistic\npreferences and preserved, in some cases, the frontal appearance and\nfeatures from Classical models. All the same, the absence of the *polos*\nand comparison with the types of banqueters could link the bust to the\nimage of an offerer or a deceased woman.[^2] This hairstyle with linear,\nserpentine locks, the eyes with raised-band eyelids, and the sinuous\nline of the mouth characterize many fictile Tarentine heads from the\nfirst half of the fifth century through the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^3]\n\nA very close comparison, in terms of both the hairstyle and the\nrendering of facial features, can be made with a number of female heads\nprobably belonging to statues originally from Saturo. Comparison can be\nmade with another head, smaller in format, seen alongside a reclining\nfigure and dating to the middle of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> and with a female head\nantefix from the sanctuary of Persephone in Contrada Mannella at Locri,\ndating to the middle of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^4] Tarentine influence\nseems evident as well in the seated female figure in a terracotta slab\nthat decorated the interior of a chamber tomb in Centuripe in the third\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, which is\nsimilar to the Getty head in its hairstyle and in the facial features\nthat bespeak a Classical model.[^5] This hairstyle is also found in a\nsoft-stone head that can be dated between the last quarter of the fourth\ncentury and the first quarter of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, which attests to the\npresence of a single stylistic approach among both coroplasts and\nsculptors.[^6] These comparisons suggest the dating of this type to\napproximately the middle of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^1]: This hole is ancient and was made in the wet or pre-fired clay. A\n    number of busts from Morgantina feature a small hole on the neck,\n    probably intended for the insertion of ornaments.

      "description": "\nThe face is set upon a strong neck marked by two Venus rings. The\nfeatures are full in form, with asymmetrical eyes and thick eyelids\nfolded downward at the outer corners. The right superciliary arch is\ncloser to and parallel with the upper eyelid. The mouth, with a fleshy\nlower lip, is close to the straight, tapering nose with its flattened\nridge; the chin is rounded with a dimple where it joins the mouth, and\nthe jaw is full. The hair, parted in the middle, and evident on the nape\nof the neck as well, is depicted by means of deep, sharp incisions,\npossibly executed with a comb-like tool, and it is held back in the\nmiddle of the forehead by a diadem. The hair is combed in thick parallel\nwaves toward the back of the neck and gathered in a roll behind the\nneck, leaving the earlobes uncovered. The ears are pierced for the\ninsertion of earrings, probably of metal.[^1]\n\nThe type is reminiscent of the votive busts widespread in southeastern\nSicily and Magna Graecia in the fifth and the second half of the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and is\ncharacterized by elements that can still be assigned to the Classical\nperiod. The piece, which retains a certain schematic rigidity\naccentuated in part by the frontal composition, displays a stereotypical\ndepiction of facial features that is common in Sicilian bust types\nconnected to the Demeter cult.[^2] Certain distinctive elements, such as\nthe linearity of the hairstyle and the roll of hair behind the neck, can\nalso be found in a number of female types from Centuripe and\nMorgantina.[^3] The detail of the Venus rings is found also in a number\nof Tarentine heads datable to the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, such as a marble head from\nTaranto now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, which is\nclose to the Getty bust in the compactness of its forms and the\ndownward-turning corners of the eyes with close-set eyebrows. Based on\nits style, the Getty head can be dated to the middle of the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^4]\n\n[^1]: The practice of drilling holes through the earlobes for the\n    insertion of metal earrings was common in the workshops of Magna\n    Graecia and Sicily; in this connection, see cat. 51.\n\n[^2]: On the problems relating to the busts from Sicily, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Ferruzza</span> 2013, with\n    bibliography; <span class=\"smcaps\">Portale</span>\n    2008, pp. 22–25; <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Kilmer</span> 1977, pp. 122–23,\n    159–76. n. 52. The most recent studies on this topic have discussed\n    the connection of votive female busts to the Demeter and\n    Kore-Persephone cult; underlining how the possible association of a\n    votive with a specific god or goddess can only be affirmed by study\n    of the entire system of dedications.

The nose is small and\nthe fleshy neck is marked at its proper right side by a wrinkle made by\nthe slightly tipped head. The low forehead is framed by hair gathered in\ntwo wavy bands and combed softly toward the occiput, with two ringlets\nfalling alongside the neck, leaving the ears uncovered. The figure wears\ndisc-shaped earrings. At the back of the head, the hair, parted in the\nmiddle, is combed into horizontal and parallel waves rendered by quickly\nexecuted incisions. On the nape of the neck, there is a circular hole.\n\nThe softness of the shaping and rendering, the slight turn of the head,\nthe barely parted lips, the way the eyes are sunk into the orbital\ncavities, and the prominence of the superciliary arches, which emphasize\nthe intensity of the gaze and accentuate the pictorial surface values,\nall place this head in the context of Tarentine sculpture of Praxitelean\ninspiration.[^1] In particular, one terracotta female head, now in\nKassel. dated from the beginning of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, presents similar\ncharacteristics, such as the hairstyle with two curls dropping down\nalongside the neck and the regular, nuanced facial features with sunken\neyes with a rim of shadow just beneath the eyebrows.[^2] The rounded\nstrands of hair form loose waves from a central part down to the\ntemples, with curls falling along either side of the neck. They also\nrecur in a mold in the Getty Museum (inv. 74.AD.54 reproducing a female\nhead signed “LY,” referring perhaps to a Tarentine coroplast active in\nthe middle and third quarter of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^3] This may also be\ncompared with another head from Taranto in Basel, which has a similar\nhairstyle but is in a frontal position and is characterized by a harsher\nexpression. For the treatment of the hairstyle and the coloristic\nrendering of the locks, a comparison can also be made with a bust of a\nseated female figure in Basel datable to the second quarter of the\nfourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> period\nin which the Getty head might be dated<span\nclass=\"smcaps\">.</span>[^4]\n\n[^1]: For comparable facial features, see the marble female head dating\n    to the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Belli Pasqua</span> 1995, p. 78,\n    vol. 4, no. 8, and the head at [cat. 14](14).

      "description": "\nThe head, turned to the left, presents an elongated face with oval eyes\nand thickened eyelids, straight nose and fleshy lips (especially the\nlower one), a full chin, and a short neck. The hair is treated as large\nlocks applied to the head, separated by sharp, deep cuts, arranged\nradially around the face, and hanging on either side of the face in\ntubular curls. At the nape of the neck, there is a wide, irregularly\nshaped hole. The physiognomy of the face is reminiscent of Tarentine\nexamples dating to the middle and second half of the fourth century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and characterized by a\nsomber expression accentuated by the tilt of the head. The hairstyle and\nthe tubular ringlets are more unusual. A head in Copenhagen, dating to\nthe second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, presents the same tilt, the\nregular facial features, and the hair treated in molded modules, clumped\nroughly over the forehead, and articulated by a potter’s tool.[^1] In\ncentral Italy, such so-called Libyan ringlets can be found in a number\nof heads with elongated faces datable between the late fourth and the\nthird century centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> These heads have been linked\nwith a number of Tarentine antefixes dating to the beginning of the\nfourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, as well\nas with funerary sculptures of the second half of the fourth century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, though the ringlets in\nthat case are arranged vertically on either side of the face in groups\nof two or three.[^2] In the context of the third century, this type of\nhairstyle seems reminiscent of that of Isis, adopted by Egyptian queens.\nTwo terracotta female heads now in the Louvre, similar to the head of\nDemeter Isis on the Farnese Cup (Tazza Farnese) in Naples, offer\nsignificant comparisons. A high-relief of Aphrodite-Berenice, found in\nthe agora of Cyrene and alluding to the marriage between Berenice and\nPtolemy III Euergetes (performed in 246 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>), shows potential affinities\nin the tilt of the head and in the hairstyle.[^3]\n\nThe lack of more exact comparisons to the Getty head means that no\nprecise dating is possible. In stylistic terms, the head can be\ngenerically attributed to the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the period of most of the\ncomparable facial features from the Tarentine area, but the possibility\nthat, given the type of hairstyle, this head might date to around the\nmiddle of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> should not be ruled out<span\nclass=\"smcaps\">.</span>\n\n[^1]: <span class=\"smcaps\">Fischer-Hansen</span> 1992,\n    p. 87, no. 60 (dating from 350–325 <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>).

      "description": "\nThis head, depicting a young male, is tilted toward the left. The face\nis lean and elongated, and the eyes are almond-shaped, irregular, and\nasymmetrical, with thick eyelids. The nose is straight and wide at the\nbase; the lips are well shaped; the lower lip is fleshier than the\nupper. The low forehead is framed by flame-shaped locks of hair that are\ndefined by narrow, deep incisions; the locks begin in the center of the\nforehead and spread out on either side of the face, leaving the ears\nuncovered. An incised line divides the nape of the neck into two parts,\nand the locks in the back are rendered only through roughly molded\nshapes. The hairstyle, with the wavy hair pushed back as if the figure\nwere in motion, is reminiscent of the head of Pyrrhus in the limestone\nmetope depicting a battle scene from the Doric frieze of a *naiskos*\ndatable to around 270 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>—a\nreadaptation of the motif of a horseman striking from a rearing horse,\nformerly on the monument commemorating the Battle of the Granicus fought\nbetween Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire in 334 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, carved by Lysippos.[^1] This\ntype of hairstyle seems to link to the portraiture of Alexander, a\nsource of inspiration for coroplasts in the Tarentine area and diffused\nthrough various versions in Magna Graecia and Etruria in the third\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> Close\nanalogies to this wavy hair can be found in a Tarentine antefix. The\nmethod of rendering the hair through deeply incised curly locks is also\npresent, though in more rigid form, in other iconographies that were\nwidespread in the Tarentine area between the middle of the fourth and\nthe third century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, as\ncan be seen, for example, in a Gorgon-head antefix now in the British\nMuseum and in a fragment of a mask depicting Pan from Monte Sannace.[^2]\nThe expression of pathos, the low forehead, the fine, low eyebrows, and\nthe accentuated tilt of the head are also reminiscent of a male head\ndating to the beginning of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and assignable to the\npediment decoration of the sanctuary at Lo Scasato in Falerii, in which\na Tarentine component has been acknowledged.[^3] The Getty head might\ndate from around the first half of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^1]: For the influence of Lysippos in Taras, see P.

      "description": "\nThe head of a young man is characterized by a long neck that broadens\ntoward the base and an elongated oval face with finely defined features.\nThe eyebrows are lowered, the eyes are small and regularly shaped, with\nsharply outlined eyelids; the nose is straight; the mouth is nicely\ndesigned with half-open lips. The smooth hair is parted in the center of\na broad forehead; the hair is combed forward in small, sparse tufts\ndefined by small incisions; the hair leaves the ears uncovered.\n\nOn the back of the neck, in contrast, the hair is rendered in broad,\nflattened locks by simple parallel grooves. There is a regular-shaped\ncircular hole in the back, where the neck attaches to the head. The\nface, which presents a number of distinctive features, is characterized\nby a vaguely languid expression emphasized by the half-open lips. This\ntype does not appear to be particularly common in the Tarentine area of\nthe Hellenistic period. It is possible, however, to make some comparison\nwith a head from Taranto now in Musei Civici di Trieste, characterized\nby an especially lean adolescent face, but with a somewhat different\nrendering of the hairstyle; and with two other statuette heads from the\nvotive deposits of the Borgo Arsenale Militare and the Via Duca degli\nAbruzzi.[^1] The type of hairstyle, in particular, can be found in\nnumerous terracotta heads belonging to the central Italic area and\ndatable between the end of the fourth and the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2] The long, tubular neck,\nthe elongated face, and the hairstyle characterized by flattened locks\ncan be linked to some heads from the third and second centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> found in Campania.[^3]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: See the piece in the Musei Civici di Trieste, inv. 4008; also the\n    head from the Borgo Arsenale Militare, inv. 200112; and the head\n    from the votive deposit of the Via Duca degli Abruzzi, inv. 162845\n    in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto.\n\n[^2]: Compare with the terracotta head of a young man in the Museo\n    Gregoriano Etrusco Vaticano: S. Ensoli, “Alessandro: L’immagine del\n    principe,” in <span class=\"smcaps\">Moreno</span>\n    1995, pp. 331–37, fig. 4; for the scheme of the elongated face, see\n    also the bust from Lucera discussed in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">D’Ercole</span> 1990, pp. 90–91,\n    103, pl. 27b, from the end of the fourth and the third centuries\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> The lean face,\n    half-open lips, and rapt gaze are also reminiscent of the votive\n    terracotta head from the Portonaccio Sanctuary at Veii dating to the\n    end of the fifth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, an early example of a\n    typological portrait of an adolescent: F. Roncalli, “L’arte,” in G.\n    Pugliese Carratelli and M. Pallottino, eds., *Rasenna: Storia e\n    civiltà degli Etruschi* (Milan, 1986), pp. 533–676, esp, p. 655,\n    fig. 573.\n\n[^3]: See the type of the young male head from Capua rendered with less\n    exacting workmanship, short hair, and slender, tubular neck,\n    discussed in M.

From the votive\n    deposit of the sanctuary of Minerva Medica in Rome comes a later\n    head that can be dated between 100 and 70 <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and which is reminiscent\n    of the Getty piece: see L.

      "description": "\nThe head of the young man is set on a broad neck that tapers from the\nbase; it tilts slightly to the left. The face is full; the large eyes\nhave sharply outlined eyelids; the mouth is half-open with fleshy lips,\nthe thick ears are set forward, and the nose is broad at the base with\npierced nostrils. The hair is parted in the middle and arranged in\nshort, fine, wavy locks around the face, presenting a bifurcation of the\ntwo central locks of hair in the middle of the forehead. There is a\nregular-shaped circular hole above the left ear and another small hole\nabove the upper lip. On the nape of the neck, the hair is arranged on\neither side of a central part in tousled, parallel locks, defined by\ncuts. From the arrangement of the hair, one may conjecture that a band\nor a wreath was set on the head.[^1] Beneath the ears, one can see the\nseam that divides the two parts of the head. The eyes, mouth, dimple\nbeneath the nose, and hair have all been finished with a sharp tool.\n\nThe face does not feature a typical childish smile; it seems rather to\nhave the appearance of an adolescent. The closest comparison is with a\nTarentine head in Basel, dated to the end of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> It presents similar facial\ncharacteristics, such as the rendering of the hair, the fleshy mouth,\nand the structure of the head, as well as similar technical details,\nsuch as the hole above the ears. The hairstyle is slightly different\nbecause in this example the locks of hair are finer and more sparse.[^2]\nThe jug ears, the pudgy face, and the hairstyle distinguish the\niconography of the boy or young man in later instances as well.[^3] The\nGetty head, perhaps later than the one in Basel, can be dated to the\nfirst half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\nAppendix\n\nThe conical shape of the hole tapering toward the object’s interior\nindicates that a pointed instrument was inserted into the soft clay and\nthen turned in a circular fashion to enlarge the hole. If this were\nmodern, the hole would have been cut into hardened clay, using tools\nsuch as drill bits, which would have left a distinctive crisp edge at\nthe entrance and interior exit of the hole. Instead, both have a soft,\nrounded edge, which is expected with manipulation in soft clay. Equally,\nthe interior surface of the hole appears identical to the exterior and\ninterior clay surfaces of the object. If the hole were recent, the\ninterior surface would have been very smooth and different in appearance\nfrom the rest of the object’s surface.\n\nThe texture and thickness of the obscuring soil incrustation is very\neven on both exterior and interior, drawing some suspicion. Its strong\nattachment to the terracotta surface, evidenced in the area at the base\nof the neck where mechanical cleaning has been attempted, seems to\nindicate high clay content. Examination under ultraviolet light aided in\nthis interpretation, showing no presence of pigments or organic binders.\nExamination under visible light in normal conditions and magnification\nshows areas where the clay incrustation is entirely lacking, which is\nmore consistent with deposition rather than modern application. In these\nareas—many of which are high points of relief, such as the edge of the\nears and tops of the hair—the clay and some of the terracotta seem to\nhave been removed through abrasion. If the clay were applied in recent\ntimes, such areas would presumably present a different appearance, with\nthe clay smoothly transitioning to reveal the underlying terracotta,\nwhich would most likely be little affected.\n\n[^1]: One cannot prove that this figure originally wore a wreath, but\n    the presence of adolescents among banqueters is attested, for\n    instance in Sparta, where young men could attend certain parts of\n    the banquet. In this case, there was likely an emphasis on the\n    transition from the state of *pais* (child) to the state of *aner*\n    (man). On this, see P. Schmitt Pantel, *La cité au banquet: Histoire\n    des repas publics dans les cités grecques*, Collection de l’école\n    française de Rome 157 (Rome, 1992), pp. 77–78; and R. Buxton,\n    *Imaginary Greece: The Contexts of Mythology* (Cambridge \\[U.K.\\],\n    1994), pp. 21–44. Especially meaningful here is the find in Taranto\n    of a tomb of a child buried with a silver headband with applied\n    rosettes and a set composed of a skyphos and a strigil; see P. G.\n    Guzzo, “Corone d’agone, tra guerra e morte, in Magna Grecia,” in\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">La Regina 2003,</span> pp.\n    92–103, esp. p. 96.\n\n[^2]: <span class=\"smcaps\">Herdejürgen</span> 1971,\n    no. 34, pl. 14, pp. 50–51.\n\n[^3]: See, for instance, the head from Lucera in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">D’Ercole</span> 1990, pl. 24,\n    A3.XI, datable between the third and second centuries <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n"

      "description": "\nThe bust once belonged to a statue of a male figure, probably a\nbanqueter. The head, in three-quarter view, is also tilted slightly to\nthe right. The face is oval and elongated; the eyes, with clearly marked\nborders, have their outer corners turned downward; the eyebrows extend\nin an arch out to the temples. The nose is thin and straight, with a\nflat dorsal ridge; the mouth is small, with fleshy lips; the chin is\npronounced and there is a dimple between the chin and the lower lip. The\nhair on the forehead is rendered in fine, sparse locks. This gives the\nhead, at least in its present configuration, an almost bald appearance,\nwhile the hair at the nape is portrayed more clearly; from the central\npart, the hair extends out in parallel waves. The well-shaped ears must\nhave been left uncovered. The pectoral muscles are marked by slight\ngradations. The bust seems to have been conceived to be seen\nforeshortened and from below, as attested by the notable asymmetries\nbetween the two halves of the face, with the eyes differing in size and\nlevel and the central facial axis shifted to the right, making one half\nof the face more prominent.[^1]\n\nThe head presents a number of characteristics that can be found in\nTarentine coroplastic types from the end of the fifth century to the\nfourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>, such\nas the lean, elongated face; the sharply outlined eyelids; the sad,\nlowered gaze; and the chiaroscuro formed by the shadow beneath the\neyebrows. These elements recur in many small-format statuettes of\nbanqueters datable to the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2] In this bust, the rigid\nfrontality present in many earlier examples has been attenuated in favor\nof a looser, more expressive pose. The locks of hair arranged in a\nparallel, horizontal manner on the nape of the neck recur in\nLysippan-style sculpture that probably flowed into the eclectic\nstylistic vocabulary of the Tarentine coroplasts.[^3]\n\nThe identification of this piece as a figure of a banqueter is\nespecially persuasive based on comparisons with other male nude busts of\nreclining figures in Tarentine contexts of the late fifth century and\nthe fourth century centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> The iconography of the\nreclining figure that is attested by terracotta finds in the various\nvotive deposits of the city, is characterized especially by complicated\nfloral wreaths and bands. From an examination of the Tarentine\ntypologies, how the coroplasts could diversify production even while\nworking from relatively standardized types is evident. In some cases,\nthey endowed the figures with individualized facial features.[^4]\n\nThe theme of the reclining figure has given rise to a number of\nhypotheses as to the origin and identification of the male and female\ncharacters in relation to heroic, Orphic, and chthonic cults. Some have\ninterpreted this figure as the very act of the completed sacrifice,\nachieved through the depiction of the faithful.[^5]\n\nIn Macedonian wall-painting of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, whose similarity to the\npainting of Magna Graecia has already been pointed out, participants in\nthe symposium are depicted as bare-chested and are characterized by a\nlively set of gestures.[^6]\n\nAppendix\n\nThe piece had been broken and repaired before the Getty Museum acquired\nit. A thermoluminescence test conducted at the Research Laboratory for\nArchaeology and the History of Art at Oxford confirmed that the\nterracotta is of ancient manufacture.\n\n[^1]: For optical corrections in Tarentine sculpture, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Belli Pasqua</span> 1995, pp.\n    51–53, on a female head of the end of the fifth to the beginning of\n    the fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^2]: Compare the female bust, [cat. 14](14), and the bust in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Herdejürger</span> <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">1982</span>, pp. 46–47, no. 105,\n    dating to the late fifth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; see also the reclining\n    figure on a triton, datable to the first half of the fourth century\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, from the votive\n    deposit in the Via di Palma, in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Iacobone</span> 1988, pp. 69–70,\n    pl. 58a.

      "description": "\nThis fragment, probably once part of a statue, has an oval face and full\nregular features. The elongated eyes have very thick eyelids with sharp\nedges. The pupil, iris, and tear duct are emphasized, and the eyebrows\nare well defined; there is a distinct juncture between the forehead and\nthe lowered arch of the eyebrows. The nose is straight, and it directly\njoins the eyebrow arches; the mouth has fleshy, parted lips, a sinuous\nprofile, and small dimples at the sides. The gaze is slightly lowered.\nThe surface of the face has been carefully smoothed.\n\nThe definition of the facial features finds parallels in Tarentine\nterracotta heads dating from the middle of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> such as in the elongated\neyes and eyelids already present in the Severe style, and elements that\ncan be found even in mature Classicism, such as the fleshy cheeks\nenlivened by dimples at the corners of the mouth and nostrils, the broad\nflat chin, and the flat arch of the eyebrows.[^1] The head may show the\ninfluence of a sculptural prototype, perhaps in bronze, as is suggested\nby the accuracy of the features, which are close to the Attic style of\nthe second half of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> A comparison could be made\nwith the marble head of Athena in Taranto, dated to this period, which\nshares the same tendency to emphasize the eyelids, the puffed-out\ncheeks, and those features that confer greater organic qualities and\nlively expression to the faces.[^2] The details of the sensuous, fleshy\nlips and the lower part of the face clearly point to the Cirò Apollo,\ndatable to 440–430 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>,\nsuggesting the same Attic stylistic culture.[^3] The head of Theseus\nfrom the pediment of the Temple of Apollo Sosianus in Rome, which has\nbeen dated around the third quarter of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> would also seem comparable,\nespecially in the puffy flesh, the fleshy cheeks, and the thick\neyelids.[^4] It is difficult to place the Getty head chronologically.\nStylistic analysis and comparisons cited above suggest dating it to\nabout 440–430 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^1]: For the characteristics of Tarentine coroplastic art of the fifth\n    century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Herdejürgen</span> 1971, pp. 14–25;\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Orlandini</span> 1983, pp.\n    463–64.

The mouth is wide, with well-shaped lips and a smiling\nexpression. The hair is arranged in fine locks, closely plastered to the\ncranial structure, leaving the ears uncovered and turned forward. On the\nnape of the neck, the hair is rendered conventionally with incisions in\nparallel waves, parted in the center. There is a hole above the left\near.\n\nRepresentations of children are attested in the votive contexts of Magna\nGraecia in the Hellenistic age. In particular, this type of head appears\nin the *favissae* of Saturo, along with fragments of statues of boys in\na crouching position with attributes such as balls, symbolizing\nchildhood. This might point to cults of a kourotrophic nature, given\nalso the presence of the spring in the sacred precinct. Alternatively,\nas has been recently suggested, this type of offering could be dedicated\nto Aphrodite and Gaia, focusing on the possible multiplicity of the\ncult’s aspects in this sanctuary. In Taranto, many terracottas\nrepresenting children have been discovered in the “Pizzone” votive\ndeposit, probably connected with rites of passage.[^1] The type of the\ncrouching boy, widespread in the Near East and in Greece, especially\nduring the Hellenistic period,[^2] is also found in Magna Graecia,[^3]\nand in the Italic Etruscan world, in connection with the fertility of\nthe fields and the cycle of life. In the votive deposits of central\nItalic sanctuaries, they are frequently associated with statues of\nchildren in swaddling.[^4] This head, which belonged to a statue,\npossesses characteristics that are peculiar to the heads of smiling\nchildren, which are generally almost entirely glabrous (smooth and\nhairless), with sunken eyes.\n\nThis head can be dated generically through stylistic comparisons to the\nthird century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^1]: For Saturo, see the terracottas representing children from\n    Favissae 6 and 9 in <span class=\"smcaps\">Settis\n    and Parra</span> 2005*,* p. 440, nos. 363–65, from the second half\n    of the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> For Favissa 6, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Monetti 2004</span>–200<span\n    class=\"smcaps\">5</span>.

      "description": "\n\nThe standing young female figure bears the weight of her body on her\nleft leg. Her right foot rests on the base of the small pillar with a\nrectangular cross-section and her right hand rests on a capital. The\nhead is turned slightly to the left, her left arm extends down her side\nand is covered by the *chlaina* that falls behind her, leaving her\nshoulders uncovered. She wears a high-waisted chiton that drops in soft\nfolds, emphasizing the pose, which is characterized by a turn of the\nhip. Her hair, parted into six large clumps, in keeping with the\nso-called melon coiffure, is gathered into a low bun; on her head is a\nwreath of ivy leaves, with a circular element in the center. Her oval\nface has a small, fleshy mouth and a prominent nose; she wears large\ncircular earrings.\n\nThis figure belongs to the extensive typology of the female figure\nleaning against a small pillar, comparable to Tanagra figurines, which\ndeveloped from Boeotia in the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> This typology became\nincreasingly common also in Magna Graecia,[^1] in particular at\nTaranto,[^2] where it was commonly used for generic portrayals of\nAphrodite, maenads, or partially draped reclining female figures. These\nfigures rarely, if ever, provide clear indications that would identify\ntheir cult. The compositional scheme of diverging masses, characterized\nby the contrast between the upper and lower parts of the body, only\nhinted at in this case, was utilized in the early examples of leaning\nfigures, in which the intention of establishing the figures with\nunstable equilibrium can be seen. At Taranto, in particular, two types\nof female statuettes leaning on small pillars were especially\nwidespread. The first is dressed in a high-belted chiton with the head\ncrowned as in this statuette, and it may be depicted also with a\ntympanon or simply standing.[^3] The second consists of partially draped\nor nude female figures identified with Aphrodite; these would continue\nto be produced until the end of the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^4]\n\nThe statuette finds comparisons among examples that can be dated between\nthe fourth century and the middle of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> It shows extensive traces of\nthe original polychromy, characterized by strongly contrasting hues, in\nkeeping with the local style.[^5]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For dressed figures from Magna Graecia leaning against small\n    pillars, see, from Capua, <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Besques</span> 1986*,* pl. 54a–c,\n    datable from the second half of the third century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Bonghi Jovino</span> 1990, pl. 3;\n    S.

      "description": "\nThe female figure is shown frontally, standing on a curving base marked\nat the upper and lower edges by a fillet in relief and decorated by a\npair of horizontal red lines. She places her weight on the left leg,\nwhile the right leg is bent. The right arm hangs straight down the\nfigure’s side and is gathering folds of drapery in her hand; the left\narm, by contrast, is raised, and the left hand, beneath which a broad\nhem of himation hangs vertically, holds up a patera. She wears a chiton\ngathered by a belt beneath the breasts, and a himation drapes down in\nbroad transverse folds on the left side. The face is oval and elongated\nand the facial features are expressed sketchily; the hair is parted over\nthe forehead and gathered up. The statuette, made from a worn mold, must\noriginally have been painted with bright colors.[^1]\n\nThe relief could depict Polyboia, sister of Hyakinthos. She is a\ncharacter of uncertain origin, generally portrayed with attributes such\nas a cornucopia, lyre, flabellum, pyxis, grape cluster, swan, rooster,\nor phiale mesomphalos, a bowl used in rituals.[^2]\n\nSuch reliefs with a female figure or an ephebic figure are widespread in\nTarentine coroplastic production, especially between the end of the\nfourth century and the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^3]\n\nA number of myths, like that of Polyboia, entail couples involved in\ndeath and apotheosis; the story of her death as a virgin and ascension\nto heaven links her to the host of mythological figures whose\nexistential condition is closely connected with the cycle of the\nseasons. Certain sources associate Polyboia to chthonic deities like\nKore, with whom she shares the state of virginity and the specific\nattributes of the Underworld.[^4]\n\nThe cult of Hyakinthos, an ancient pre-Dorian deity closely affiliated\nwith Apollo, had its chief center at Amykles in Laconia. Pausanias\ndescribed the renowned funerary monument there in Hyakinthos’s honor,\nand it was where the *hyakinthia*—among the most important festivals of\nthe region—were held. The cult of Hyakinthos, which inherited a number\nof iconographic attributes from that of Apollo, enjoyed great popularity\nin the Laconian colony of Taras where, according to Polybius’s account\nof Hannibal’s taking of the city, a *taphos* *extra moenia* (a funerary\nmonument placed outside the city walls) allegedly stood, though its\nlocation remains in doubt.[^5] Likewise, we must assume, despite the\nabsence of written evidence, that the *hyakinthia* must have taken place\nin Taras with methods and rituals similar to those in Sparta. These\nrites probably also included elements typical of the Dionysian cult,\nsuch as the ivy wreath present in the ephebic and female examples\nreferring to the divine couple. The extensive presence in Taras of this\ntype of relief after the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> is documented by the material\nfound in the excavations of Castelsaraceno, of the Via Peluso, and of\nMasseria del Carmine, and in the votive deposits of the Via Leonida.[^6]\nIt seems likely that unforeseen political developments, such as a\nrequest of military aid from Sparta, made it necessary to reinforce\ndiplomatic relations between the two regions, in order to reaffirm their\ncommon origins through the revival of specific cults.[^7]\n\nA Tarentine findspot is nearly certain, though in the absence of\nobjective data, it is not possible to assign the relief to a more\nspecific cult context.[^8]\n\n[^1]: The bright coloration is documented by better-preserved examples\n    of the same typology. For the use of polychromy, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Abruzzese Calabrese</span> 1996, p.\n    194, no. 115.\n\n[^2]: On the mythological figure of Hyakinthos, see L.

The chthonic relevance of the deity appears to be\n    confirmed as well by the attestation of nocturnal rituals in the\n    context of the *hyakinthia*: see A. Stazio, “La documentazione\n    archeologica in Puglia,” in *Santuari di Magna Grecia*, *AttiTaranto\n    4, 1964* (Naples, 1965), pp. 153–79, pl.

See also Polybius 8.2. Lippolis’s study of this\n    type of relief refuted the identification of the Polybian *taphos*\n    with the votive deposits of the Contrada Carmine, based on\n    topographical considerations, further calling into question whether\n    these reliefs depict Polyboia and Hyakinthos: see *<span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Taranto</span>* 1995, pp. 56–58.\n\n[^6]: On the Tarentine finds, see E. Lippolis, “Pratica rituale e\n    coroplastica votiva a Taranto,” in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Nava and Osanna</span> 2005, pp.\n    91–201; <span class=\"smcaps\">Abruzzese\n    Calabrese</span> 1987, pp. 9–11.

The chronology was proposed on the basis of a partial\n    typological analysis, considering that many examples come from old\n    excavations that are inadequately documented.

      "description": "\n\nThis character is depicted with his legs crossed; his right arm is\nfolded beneath his chest, and his left hand is propped beneath his chin\nin a pose of reflection. The original seat is missing, but in accordance\nwith numerous comparisons to the type, it may be conjectured that it was\na parallelepiped-shaped altar. The figure wears a short tunic with\nsleeves and belt and, over it, a short cloak of which a section hangs\nbelow the left shoulder; on his feet are sandals with T-straps. The face\nis broad and the hair is brushed in a *speira* hairstyle*,* which forms\na compact mass with radial striations around the face; the mouth is open\nwide and is surrounded by a large trumpet shape formed by the mustache\nand the short beard, which still leaves the lips and gums visible. The\nfigure has a snub nose that is quite broad at the base; the eyebrows are\nprominent and asymmetrical and join at the middle of the forehead, which\nis creased by deep wrinkles. This figure is a depiction of the leading\nslave (*hegemòn therapon*), a key character of New Comedy: a protagonist\nin amorous intrigues, often described and portrayed in lively or mocking\nstances. Whereas in Old Comedy and Middle Comedy the slave appeared in\ngrotesque costume, the New Comedy figure wears only the short chiton and\ncloak; these distinctive characteristics make him easily recognizable in\nthe context of New Comedy masks.[^1] In particular, the snub nose, the\n*speira* hairstyle (often painted red to emphasize the character’s\nnegative nature), and especially the singular “trumpet” that frames and\ndeforms the mouth—previously found in Old Comedy and Middle Comedy as\npermanent attributes of the character—appear more stylized in this\nperiod.\n\nThe character of the seated leading slave, who has escaped from some\ndangerous situation and takes refuge in a sanctuary, is derived from\nAthenian typological models. It is found in a number of variants and\ninterpretations in numerous centers of Greece and the Mediterranean\nbasin between the end of the fourth century and the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2]\n\nIn Magna Graecia and in Sicily, the extensive presence in funerary\ndeposits of terracottas with theatrical subjects and powerful symbolic\nand religious values has generally been linked to the spread of the cult\nof Dionysos, and can be interpreted in eschatological terms.[^3]\n\nIn the Hellenistic period, as is known from funerary deposits—especially\nfrom non-adult tombs—Taras seems to have become the most active center\nin Magna Graecia for the coroplastic production of material with a\ntheatrical subject, a context to which this type may be tentatively\nlinked. It is prevalent in such deposits dated between the last quarter\nof the third century and the first quarter of the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^4] It has been proposed\nthat the statuettes of theatrical subjects, including this Getty\nstatuette, could be linked not only to the Dionysian cult but also to\nburial sites of children who died at an age when they were preparing to\nparticipate with adults in the life of the theater; such statuettes\ncould therefore be intended to emphasize the transition from childhood\nto maturity.[^5]\n\nAt Lipari, where a prolific production of comic statuettes extends over\na period from the first half of the fourth century to the first half of\nthe third century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the\ntype of the seated leading slave is represented by a group of Middle\nComedy statuettes, while the standing slave is the type that is chiefly\ndocumented for New Comedy. The mask of chief servant is, in any case,\nthe type most frequently depicted in New Comedy terracottas of\nLipari.[^6]\n\nIn Morgantina, statuettes of comic actors derived from the Attic\nrepertory and elaborated on a local basis have been found in both\nsanctuaries and dwellings, and they seem to date primarily between 330\nand 280 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> According to\nBell, they should be related to the cult of Demeter.[^7] From Centuripe\nin Sicily comes a statuette of a slave seated on an altar, with legs\ncrossed, the trumpet-shaped mouth, and the short cape tossed over the\nleft shoulder; another piece representing a slave seated on an altar\ncomes from the votive deposit of Butera dating from the second half of\nthe fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^8]\n\nThe slave taking refuge on an altar is also depicted on Sicilian\nred-figured vases, as for example on a skyphos from Manfria that\ninterprets Attic typologies in a peculiar local vein.[^9]\n\n[^1]: The mask of the leading slave is documented in the catalogue of\n    Julius Pollux, *Onomastikon* 4.148.

      "description": "\nThis figure, hunched slightly forward, is seated upon a stool;\noriginally the arms were extended forward. She wears a chiton beneath\nwhich it is easy to make out the sagging breasts and the belly. The very\nlarge head has pronounced, roughly modeled facial features that\ncaricature the elderly female character. The hair is brushed in an arch\nover the forehead and raised in the middle, pulled back into a sort of\n*sakkos* that culminates in a broad bow. The mouth is large with\nhalf-open swollen lips twisted into a mocking smile; the eyes are\nelongated with upper eyelids exaggerated in order to convey the idea of\nswelling. The nose is broad, the eyebrows are furrowed, and the forehead\nis marked by two deep creases. She wears sandals on her feet, and there\nare small holes on either the side of the head.\n\nStatuettes depicting seated old women can fit into the repertory of\ncomic-theater types, in which the comic force sprang precisely from an\nemphasis on physical decay. Figures are often accompanied by wineskins\nor skyphoi*,* evident allusions to the motif of the drunken old woman,\nwhich is one of the best known iconographies in the category of genre\nsubjects.[^1] In some cases, statuettes of old women are depicted\nholding babies or children, and in such cases they can more readily be\nidentified as elderly nurses; in this kourotrophic context, the figures\nact as symbolic objects intended to protect the life of a young\nchild.[^2] The type features no characterizing attributes, save perhaps\nfor the accentuation of physical decay and the mocking expression, which\nare found also in the types of elderly *hetairai*;[^3] it therefore\nseems more likely that this is a genre figure assignable to the context\nof the rich production of Magna Graecia and Sicily, dating from the\nfourth and third centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, and oriented toward comic\nthemes.[^4]\n\nAt Lipari, statuettes depicting elderly female slaves or housekeepers\nhave been identified by Bernabò Brea as Middle Comedy characters, while\nvarious mask typologies have been found in funerary deposits of the late\nfourth century and the first half of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> Some of these are\ncharacterized by mouths with only two surviving teeth.[^5] Figures of\nelderly seated women are also present in Sicily in funerary deposits\nfrom the second century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>\nin Centuripe. The type has significant correspondences in Taranto where,\namong the five seated women found in funerary deposits that can be dated\nto the period from the first quarter of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> to the first quarter of the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, none of\nthem is holding a child, while some have folded arms. Here, too, the\ncustom of placing statuettes of theatrical subjects in tombs must have\nhad a link to the cult of Dionysos, which is intimately related with the\nfunerary world and with an eschatological vision of the afterlife.[^6]\n\n[^1]: On the theme of the drunken old woman, see P.

      "description": "\n\nThe slender character, with skinny arms, stands with its right leg\nslightly bent and tucked behind; the head is turning sharply to the\nleft. The left arm is poised on the hip while the right arm is\noutstretched to the side in a declamatory gesture. The figure is wearing\na short chiton and cloak that covers the shoulders, then crosses over\nbehind the back and is rolled up around the waist like a sash.\nFluttering folds at the sides suggest the figure’s dancelike movement.\n\nThe hair, arranged in an arch over the forehead, is held back by a\n_kekruphalos_, the ends of which are knotted over the forehead. The nose\nis hooked; the large eyebrows are furrowed, forming two creases across\nthe forehead, which is marked by a large protuberance; the gaze is grim.\n\nThe chiton and the short cloak rolled over the hips, as well as the\nheaddress and the short boots, are specific features of the costume of\nArtemis, in keeping with an iconography that originated in the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and spread\nthroughout the Hellenistic period in a number of variants.[^1]\n\nThe arm raised to one side, too, is typical of many statuary types, such\nas the small statue of Artemis from Piraeus, datable to the third\nquarter of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2] The hand on the hip is\nalso found in various depictions of the goddess, holding either bow and\nquiver or a torch, a recurrent theme in both Hellenistic coroplastic art\nand South Italian vase iconography. In particular, the exaggerated,\ntheatrical pose of the character, which seems to parody common\niconographies of the pugnacious goddess between the fourth century and\nthe third century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC,</span>\nmight be intended to evoke Artemis herself in the throes of rage over a\nmisdeed or in a querulous stance.[^3] In this case, it is likely that\nthe figure represents an actor performing in a “phlyax farce” or\nhilarotragedy, in the role of either the goddess or a member of her\nentourage; indeed, phlyax plays owed their popularity to the sort of\ncaricatural deformation and grotesque parody that are expressed in this\nfigure.[^4]\n\nTentatively, this character could be related to the mythological tale of\nKallisto, the Arcadian nymph who was a follower in Artemis’s virginal\nentourage; Zeus took her as a lover, however, and she bore him a son,\nArkas; according to a number of sources, Kallisto was then condemned by\nArtemis and transformed into a she-bear. The sad story of Kallisto was\nthe subject of a tragedy by Aeschylus, now lost, and a comedy by Amphis.\nEuripides also mentions her in his play *Helen*, but in general the\nliterary sources on the nymph are fragmentary and conflicting. Kallisto\nwas depicted in a number of red-figured Apulian vases that can be dated\nto a very narrow window of time, from 380 to 360 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, and possibly linked to\npolitical events that involved Arcadia (the constitution of the Arcadian\nLeague in 371 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC)</span>. In the\nscenes depicted, probably influenced by literary sources and paintings\nas well, the nymph is presented wearing a long, gauzy chiton that leaves\nthe shoulders uncovered or, in some cases, showing incipient feral\ntraits that allude to the impending metamorphosis that is her\npunishment. In this case, the statuette could depict Artemis, who\ninflicts the punishment on the nymph with an imperious gesture.[^5]\n\nIt is unclear whether the character is wearing a mask, but according to\nPollux’s description, the facial features are more reminiscent of the\nmask of a *parasitos* (sponger), especially with a view to the decidedly\n*epigrypos* (aquiline) nose and the furrowed brow with a bump in the\nmiddle. But the face may also be supposed to represent the mime’s own\nvisage, molded through his acting skill and adept use of make-up.[^6]\n\nThe piece, reportedly from Asia Minor, has been ascribed to Myrina,[^7]\nbut the figure can also be compared with a number of statuettes from the\nfunerary deposits of Taranto, datable between the last quarter of the\nthird century and the first quarter of the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> This was a period in which\nthe coroplastic repertoire was enriched with new typologies\ncharacterized by flowing movements and by a dynamic placement of the\nfigure in space. This statuette can also hypothetically be linked to a\nTarentine tomb context datable to between the end of the third century\nand the beginning of the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, on the basis of stylistic\ncomparisons and the type of clay,[^8] and in view of the popularity of\nphlyax farces—especially the plays of Rhinthon, who was active in Taras\nbetween the end of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and the beginning of the\nthird century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>—and their\ninfluence on Apulian artistic production, in close connection with\nDionysian funerary ideology.[^9]\n\n[^1]: For the iconography of Artemis in the Hellenistic period, see\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Kahil</span> 1984, in\n    particular for the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, pp. 747–51; for the\n    clothing and the hairstyle with *sakkos* or *kekruphalos*,\n    influenced also by the costumes of Amazons, compare types nos.\n    172–75, 396, 459, 470, 746, and 1066.\n\n[^2]: For the little Artemis of the Piraeus, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Kahil</span> 1984, no. 162; for the\n    type with a hand on the hip, nos. 19, 204, 405.

      "description": "\nThe female dancer has a petite, elongated physique. Her left arm is bent\nand resting on the hip, while the right arm holds the folds of the\nhimation in front as she makes a subtle dance step, in which the left\nleg extends in front of the right; the lowered head turns toward the\nright. The long chiton extends to the feet, the himation wraps softly\naround the figure, and a hem held back by the left hand falls to one\nside in zigzagging folds. Following the movement of the figure, the\ngarments form a series of fluttering folds at the feet. The face has\ndelicate features with large spherical earrings and the head features a\nmelon-style hairdo, with a round bun on the top of the head and a wreath\ndecorated with ivy and two small, round pieces of fruit.[^1]\n\nThe statuette can be assigned, both through typology and clay, to the\nTarentine milieu. The type of female dancer articulated in space\nprobably originated in Attica at the beginning of the fourth century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2] It spread into the\nTanagra repertory, recurring in South Italy and especially in Tarentine\nfunerary deposits of the third century and the first quarter of the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, when\nthere was a notable recovery in Taranto of funerary coroplastic\nproduction with an enriched iconographic repertory and improved\ntechnical quality.[^3] A number of Tarentine statuettes present a\nsimilar iconographic scheme and stylistic characteristics, including the\nelongated torso and the dynamism of the figure, similar to the type of\nthe late third-century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> bronze statuette in the Metropolitan Museum of\nArt known as the Baker Dancer<span\nclass=\"smcaps\">,</span> in which elements of\nAlexandrian style have been recognized.[^4]\n\nThe Getty dancer shows a clear Dionysian character, to which the ivy\nwreath also points; Dionysian elements played a dominant role in the\nTarentine funerary iconography of the fourth and third centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^5] Further evidence of the\npopularity of the type in the coroplastic production comes from Sicily,\nparticularly in a number of examples of female dancers from Morgantina,\nSyracuse, Cefalù, and Monte Saraceno, generally dating from the third\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^6]\n\nFemale dancers are well attested in the Hellenistic period**,**\nincluding among the votive deposits of the sanctuaries of Demeter.\nCorinth, for instance, is the source of a number of examples datable\nbetween the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the third\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> These show a\nnumber of recurring characteristics, such as the left arm on the hip;\nthe drapery that entirely envelops the figure, forming fluttering folds\nin motion; and a foreshortened composition.[^7] Figures of female\ndancers that are very similar to this one, characterized by a rich\nmovement of the drapery—which is reminiscent of the stylistic signature\nof some Hellenistic sculptors—have also been found in Priene, Pergamon,\nand Troy, where they would continue to be produced until the first\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^8]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Appendix\n\nThe statuette was examined under polarized light microscopy (PLM) and\nX-ray fluorescence. The blue was identified as Egyptian blue and the\nwhite as white lead. There is no indication of modern repainting.\n\n[^1]: For the clothing of the dancers, see L.

      "description": "\nThe little Eros is resting its weight on its bent left leg while its\nright leg is extended to one side; with both arms it embraces the neck\nof a deer, which rests its muzzle on the Eros’s left cheek. The Eros’s\nhead is tilted slightly while its shoulders are turned toward the\nanimal. The face is plump; the eyes are round with indications of\npupils; the mouth is fleshy; the hair cascades down onto the shoulders\nin wavy locks and is woven into a braid from the center of the forehead\nbackward. The Eros is dressed only in a chlamys fastened on the right\nshoulder with a circular clasp; his feet are shod with sandals. The\nEros’s wings are spread. The front of the fat body is naked and folds of\nflesh are indicated on the inner thighs and abdomen. The figures are set\nupon a low, hollow, parallelepiped-shaped base.\n\nThe child Eros is found throughout coroplastic production in southern\nItaly mostly from the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> It was probably derived from\nGreek models and adapted for the needs of local worship.[^1] The type\ncovered only with a chlamys, which is quite common, is accompanied by\nattributes that allude to the multiplicity of functions that the figure\nof the Eros could perform. When found accompanied by an animal in South\nItaly, this type is primarily associated with funerary deposits, as is\nthe case in Taranto and Metaponto.[^2] The subject can also take on\nother meanings in connection with the sphere of Aphrodite, mystery and\nDionysian cults, or rites of passage from childhood to youth. In the\nabsence of a specific context, however, these references must remain\nmerely speculative.[^3]\n\nThe type can be dated between the end of the fourth century and the\nfirst half of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> on the basis of stylistic\ncomparisons with statuettes originating from datable contexts. Although\na Sicilian findspot has been proposed, the type also has affinities with\nTarentine pieces.[^4]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: On the iconography of the Eros and the multiple meanings attached\n    to the image, see <span class=\"smcaps\">Hermary and\n    Cassimatis</span> 1986, pp. 939–41*.*\n\n[^2]: In terracotta figurines, Eros is more commonly accompanied by\n    piglets, dolphins, or birds.

      "description": "\nThe character is depicted in a crouching position. The head is inclined\nto the proper left, the arms are extending forward, and the hands may\nhave held a weapon (a sword or an axe). The figure wears an enveloping\ntunic that extends down to its feet, which is fastened in the front by a\nbroad band with a raised edge; it wears a fluttering short cape about\nits shoulders; on its head is a Phrygian cap with broad earflaps, from\nwhich curly locks of hair and a spherical earring emerge. In the back,\nthere is a small, oval-shaped hole: the body and the head were made with\nbivalve molds; the arms and the feet were added to the figure before\nfiring.[^1]\n\nThe statuette must originally have been correlated with another figure,\nand probably formed part of the plastic decoration of an Apulian or\nCanosan vase; such vases were often adorned with groups of warriors in\nmotion.[^2] As to the iconography, the Eastern headdress links this\nfigure to the typology of the Amazon, depicted in motion as she is about\nto deal a blow with her weapon. The theme of Amazons in combat enjoyed\ngreat popularity in southern Italy during the Hellenistic period, and it\nis documented in a variety of materials, with special diffusion of the\ntheme in funerary contexts. Amazons are generally depicted in vigorous\nmovement that either raises their clothing or uncovers their breasts,\nand in situations of combat with Greek warriors, though there are very\nfew comparisons for this particular crouching scheme. Although Amazons\nare more commonly depicted with a short chiton, the long tunic with a\ncentral sash beneath the breasts points in any case to an Eastern\ncontext.[^3] Often confused with the Arimasps, legendary Eastern\nwarriors who were mostly depicted fighting griffins and with whom they\nshared numerous iconographic characteristics, the Amazons presented\nsigns of femininity and differentiation, signs which in some cases\nconsisted solely of ornaments such as earrings and bracelets.[^4] The\niconography of the Amazons first began to take on funerary significance\nin Asia Minor and was introduced to Taras in the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, forming part of the\niconographic repertory of funerary monument decoration.[^5] The\nstatuette may generically be assigned to the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: Before the Getty acquired it, this statuette had been identified\n    as a fisherman and mounted on an inappropriate trapezoidal base\n    (71.AD.138.2), a procedure that is not uncommon in artifacts\n    intended for the antiquities trade.\n\n[^2]: The crouching position can also be found in figures decorating the\n    vases of Canosa; see, for instance, the *epichysis* (wine pitcher)\n    from the Lagrasta I hypogeum of Canosa depicting a female figure on\n    her knees, with a cape puffing out over her shoulders, datable from\n    the third century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, in R.

The figure on the right,\nwith torso seen frontally and legs crossed in three-quarter view, turns\nher head toward her companion and lays an arm around her; with her right\nhand, she lifts a large tympanon, which touches the plant. She wears a\nV-neck chiton with sleeves, belted beneath her breasts, and a himation\nsoftly draped over her legs. The maenad on the left, slightly\nforeshortened, carries the *thyrsus* in her lap; her himation leaves her\nright shoulder uncovered. Both maenads wear their hair loosely pulled\nback; it is piled up in the middle on the left-hand figure. In the\nmiddle of the base is a hole for attaching the relief to a wooden\nsarcophagus; at the back of the relief, extensive traces of pink pigment\nare visible.[^1]\n\nThe relief, made with a mold, is an openwork with hand-finished details;\ngilding was commonly used on fictile products in order to imitate more\nexpensive varieties of decoration. These appliqués were produced in\nTaras in the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> in conjunction with the\nrevival of lavish funerary customs, probably inspired by luxurious\nobjects from Macedonia and Scythia; they were exported to a number of\ncenters in Magna Graecia. Such a relief was probably fastened to the\nhead of a *kline* (bed) and arranged so as to create friezes in a\ndynamic and flamboyant style. For this reason, the most common themes\nwere narratives that lent themselves to a compositional continuum, such\nas the battle between Lapiths and Centaurs or that between griffins and\nAmazons or Arimasps, with clear iconographic and formal references to\nthe limestone funerary reliefs that were popular in Taranto beginning in\nthe first half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^2]\n\nA relief in Basel, practically identical to this one, also preserves\nsimilar traces of pink pigment and was dated by Lullies to the third\nquarter of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^3] Recently, on the basis\nof the iconography and the Dionysian themes, a parallel was proposed\nbetween Tarentine appliqués and a bas-relief ivory figurine found in the\nsecond tomb of the royal necropolis of Vergina, intended as decoration\nfor a wooden funerary *kline*; this comparison revives the problem of\neconomic and cultural relations between the two areas.[^4] Some themes,\nsuch as pairs of real and fantastic animals, or Dionysian figures partly\noutstretched on the ground with drapery wrapped around their legs, can\nbe found also in the tempera-painted decorations on the marble *klinai*\nof the chamber tomb from Cassandreia, dating from the end of the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^5] A late\nfourth-century terracotta from Morgantina presents in the front a\npainted panel, probably part of a garment, representing a ritual scene\nwith two figures comparable to the maenads of this appliqué: a seated\nfemale holding a tympanon against a pink background next to a reclining\nmaenad probably holding a *thyrsus*; two female dancers are placed\nsymmetrically at the sides of the panels. The scene, in this case as in\nother painted panels on Sicilian busts, is connected to the cult of\nDemeter and Persephone, the tutelary deities of Sicily, protectors of\nthe fecundity of nature and of women, and deeply connected with the\nchthonian sphere.[^6]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: On Tarentine openwork reliefs, see <span class=\"smcaps\">Lullies</span>\n    1977, with bibliography; Tarentine reliefs also spread to other centers in\n    southern Italy; see, for example, <span class=\"smcaps\">Della Torre and Ciaghi</span> 1980, p. 56*,* pl.

      "description": "\nThe Arimasp with a Phrygian cap is portrayed in profile facing to his\nright, with sword unsheathed. He portrayed in the act of striking his\nadversary, probably a griffin, while leaning on the *pelta* set on the\nground. His right leg is bent and thrust forward, the left kneels on the\nground, and the bust is rigidly inclined backward. In keeping with the\niconography of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the Eastern warrior wears a\nPhrygian cap, a short chiton belted under the chest and, over it, a\n*chlamys* that, following the warrior’s motions, is lifting to one side,\nforming a series of fluted folds.[^1]\n\nArimasps were depicted in Attic products from the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> that are documented in\nTaranto. They are often shown battling griffins and conform to\nconventional iconographic schemes, such as the short tunic, the crescent\nshield, and the pointed hat. In other Tarentine appliqués, Arimasps are\ndepicted fighting one or two griffins, a recurring theme both in Apulian\nvase decorations and in Tarentine soft-stone reliefs, which show the\nsame fondness for movement, often precarious, and for fluttering\ndrapery.[^2] According to the analysis proposed by Wiesner, the\niconography of the Arimasps originated in the Black Sea and in the Greek\ncolonies of the Pontos region, and then established itself in Magna\nGraecia and in Taras also, through the intermediary of Metaponto. It\nbecame a favorite motif among the Pythagoreans inasmuch as it symbolized\nhope for an afterlife.[^3]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: On the iconography of the Arimasps, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Gorbounova</span> 1997, esp. no.\n    21, datable to the second half of the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> See also K.

      "description": "\nThe figure stands on an irregularly shaped base. The body’s weight rests\non the right leg, while the left leg is bent, with the left foot resting\non a projection that resembles a low rocky relief. The head is turned\ntoward the left; the belly is plump, with the linea alba defined. The\nfacial features are delicate and drawn in a soft chiaroscuro, giving the\nface a vaguely pathetic aspect; the long hair, parted in the center, is\narranged in wavy locks, with two long ringlets draped onto the chest; in\nthe back, the hair is gathered in a soft ponytail. A wreath with pointed\nleaves crowns the head. The ample himation is draped over the figure’s\nleft shoulder, leaving the torso and right shoulder bare, then rolled up\non the hips, falling to the left in ample, thick folds. The feet are\nshod with high sandals. The kithara, held in the left hand, leans\nagainst the left shoulder. The right arm is bent and extended forward;\nthe right hand, resting against the belly, holds the *plektron*.\n\nThe statuette depicts a crowned god with a kithara, probably Apollo or\nDionysos, as the crown with triangular leaves seems to suggest. This\nsubject was extensively portrayed in Magna Graecia and in Sicily in both\nvase-paintings and the coroplastic art. The type of Apollo with kithara,\ncreated in sculpture of the Classical age, was variously interpreted in\nthe Hellenistic age. Particularly in the first half of the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the\niconography of Apollo became the subject of new depictions, influenced\nby the statuary, which tended to emphasize the image of the musician and\ninspiring god. Apollo shared various iconographic affinities with the\nDionysos as well, such as the hairstyle, the crown of ivy leaves, and\nthe himation draped around the legs.[^1]\n\nThe iconography of Dionysos holding a lyre or kithara occurs rather\ninfrequently and only at the end of the fifth century BC. It is\nrepresented, for example, in the Apulian context in a small group of\nred-figured vases decorated by the White Saccos Painter in the first\nhalf of the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, probably reflecting a new tendency in\nGreek religion and an iconographic syncretism between Apollo and\nDionysos already evident in the sculpture of Dionysos with kithara in\nthe pediment of the Classical temple of Apollo at Delphi (360–320\nBC).[^2]\n\nDepictions of Apollo standing nude or partially clothed with a foot\nresting on a rocky elevation were preferred in the Hellenistic period\nfor the unstable rhythm of the pose, which gave greater dynamism and\nsharper tension in accordance with the new concept of the figure.\n\nSome distinctive features, such as the cloak wrapping around the legs,\nthe free left leg, the kithara held on the left side with the arm raised\nto the head—as in the Apollo Lykaios by Praxiteles—and the long hair\ndrawn back also characterize the Apollo Kitharoidos sculpted by\nTimarchides in 180 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>. It\nis known in various copies, the most complete of which is the so-called\nApollo of Cyrene.[^3] However, this type was extensively modified in its\nmany variants with the introduction of other elements, some of which\nappear in this statuette, such as the position of the right arm, bent\nforward with the *plektron* in hand.[^4] In stylistic terms, this figure\nemphasizes Praxitelean influences, as evident for example in the Apollo\nLykaios, upon which this statuette seems vaguely to be modeled,\nespecially in the flexing position of the body, the soft, full nude\nfigure, and the feminine hairstyle.[^5]\n\nThe Getty statuette can be assigned to the production of Canosa in the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; there\nis a very close parallel in another statuette, probably made from the\nsame molds, now in a Swiss private collection, and also likely\noriginating in Canosa.[^6] The type of the Apollo Kitharoidos is well\ndocumented in coroplastic art, with numerous eclectic variants, from\nother centers in Magna Graecia and Sicily—in Taranto, Egnazia, Caulonia,\nPaestum, and Centuripe.[^7] The popularity of the Apollo Kitharoidos\niconography in Magna Graecia is also documented as early as the\nClassical period on a stater from Metaponto dating from 430 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> It shows Apollo seated,\nlooking right, and intently playing a large kithara.[^8]\n\nA number of statuettes of Apollo standing with kithara and *plektron*\nwere also found among the deposits in the Campetti sanctuary at Veii,\nwhich are dated to the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^9] At Myrina in Asia Minor,\nthe type is well attested and fits into the more common production of\nHellenistic coroplastic art, documenting an intense circulation of\ntypologies and iconographies between eastern and western workshops.[^10]\nThis Apollo is shown with the so-called Italiote kithara, which is well\ndocumented in the decorative repertory of South Italian vase-painting as\nearly as 360 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^11]\nCharacterized by a long rectangular shape, this instrument has narrow,\nstraight vertical arms, a rectangular soundbox, and small discs at the\nends of the arms. The number of strings can vary from five to nine. This\ninstrument is also often associated with objects that symbolize\nmatrimonial rites, and it appears in a symposium scene painted in a\nMacedonian chamber tomb.[^12]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Appendix\n\nThe work was manufactured in three principal parts, each pushed into an\nopen piece mold consisting of the body and head, three-quarters of the\nright arm, and the base. The body was formed by joining the front and\nback of the figure, indicated by the seams up both sides that join at\nthe crown of the head. The right arm was manufactured separately, and\nseams are visible at the bicep and the hand. The figure is hollow but\ndoes not have a hollow underside; rather it has a separately made base.\nIn clay and handling, the base is consistent with the body and right arm\nand continues the details and profile of the figure on its exterior. On\nthe underside, there is a preserved swirl, which appears to have been\nrendered with the tip of a finger while the clay was still wet.\n\nNormally the bottom would have been left open as a ventilation hole to\nprevent potential expansion or explosion during firing. However, because\nof the clay used, the continuous figural profile, and the lack of\nfracturing or any signs of later addition, it is apparent that the base\nwith preserved swirl is original to the piece.\n\nStructurally, the piece is sound but shows evidence that the head had\nbeen broken off and the figure broken in two at the waist. Both areas\nshow plaster fills with overpaint, apparent in visible and ultraviolet\nlight. After examination under a microscope and sample analysis with PLM\nand XRF, the extent of overpainting was found to be confined to the\nplaster fills, and none of the coloration of the figure had been\nrefreshed or renewed.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the iconography of Apollo in the early Hellenistic period in\n    Magna Graecia and Sicily, see W.

      "description": "\nThe *arula*, parallelepiped in shape, is squared off with rectangular\ncornices at the top and the base, above which a thin fillet serves as a\nground line for the figures. The underside was hollowed out in order to\nreduce the weight and to facilitate firing. The four faces are decorated\nwith molded figures of animals in low relief, which were finished with a\npotter’s rib.[^1] The letters ΔΙΟ (Dionysos) are inscribed on the top\nsurface.[^2]\n\nOn side A, a goat is depicted in a stationary stance facing left, with\nfront and back legs joined and firmly planted on the ground. The\nanimal’s head is lowered, with the muzzle pressed against its chest as\nif preparing to charge the panther on the adjacent side. The goat has\ndelicate horns that curve back along the neck, a short upturned tail, a\nprominent phallus, and fleece rendered in small, wavy locks.\n\nOn side B, a panther moves toward the right, with its left paw raised.\nThe body is sinuous and arched, with a well-defined attachment of the\nback left leg; the long tail twists and curves upward in a sigmate\nshape.\n\nOn side C, a lioness faces left with her right front paw raised. Her\nbody is long, narrowing at the middle, and the fur is rendered in a\nstylized manner with short, flame-shaped locks; the tail and the\nattachment of the back leg are similar to the preceding figure.\n\nOn side D, a griffin advances toward the right, confronting the lioness\non the adjacent side with its left front paw lifted and wings spread;\nthey are attached at the shoulder and defined by incised, elongated\nfeathers; the left (back) wing appears in profile beneath the creature’s\nhead. The anatomical parts are stylized, especially the long, flexing\nbody and the S-curved tail, which belong to the Archaic tradition.[^3]\nThis type of *arula*—small in size, made from a block of clay, and\ndecorated with animals and mythological creatures—is widespread in Magna\nGraecia, especially in Metaponto,[^4] Caulonia,[^5] and Locri,[^6] and\nis generally dated to the second half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> There are significant ties\nbetween the four animals and the deity to whom the *arula* was to be\ndedicated: the griffin, the panther, the lioness, and the goat, in fact,\nfrequently accompany Dionysos and his entourage. The association with\nthe griffin and the panther seems to be documented as far back as the\nend of the fifth century, as documented by Apulian vases. The griffin\nseems to be more closely affiliated with a type of chthonic Dionysos\nthat is probably of Thracian-Phrygian origin.[^7]\n\nIn Sicily, too, as early as in the Archaic period, *arulae* with\ndepictions of animals have been found, evidence of the early\nassimilation by the colonial world of iconographic motifs from the Greek\nand Eastern regions, motifs that, through the medium of vases as well,\npersist over time without any particular stylistic development.\nLikewise, a number of Archaic formal conventions, such as the S-shaped\ntails, found also in small Laconian or Corinthian bronzes diffused in\nthe West, would continue to appear for a long time.[^8] The most\npertinent comparison is with a number of *arulae* from Metaponto that\npresent the same typology and subjects, though they are arranged in a\ndifferent order; the use of individual molds allowed a certain\ndecorative variety within a substantially repetitive production.[^9]\n\nThere is some debate over the origin of this type: Pierre Wuilleumier\nbelieved it could be assigned to Tarentine production due to its\nsimilarity to subjects found in appliqués or in imitations of gilded\nterracotta costume jewelry, as well as in Apulian vases. Other scholars\nbelieve the type could be more properly assigned to the area of\nMetaponto, especially due to the quantity of pieces found in that\narea.[^10]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For this type of *arula*, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Meijden</span> 1993, TI 27–34 (from\n    Metaponto) and TI 35 (from Taranto), pls. 24–25, pp. 28–38, 243–44,\n    datable to the second half of the fourth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n[^2]: See the inscription dedicated to Dionysos in abbreviation and in\n    the Achaean alphabet inscribed on an Attic oinochoe dating from the\n    end of the sixth century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>: F.

      "description": "\nThe *arula* is of the type shaped like a parallelepiped box, open on the\nbottom and decorated with reliefs on both of the long sides. On the\nfront, in a heraldic arrangement, two facing felines sink their fangs\ninto an animal, perhaps a deer, which is looking backward; its legs have\nalready collapsed beneath it. The scene is bounded on the left by a\nsmall palmette, which no doubt once had a mate in a symmetrical position\nat the other extremity. On the corresponding long side, only the upper\nfragment of a palmette is preserved. The felines are shown in\nsilhouette, with their muzzles seen frontally; they are gripping the\nanimal by the neck and the rump; the bodies are slender, but the mold is\nworn and the details of the animals’ muzzles and anatomy are obscured.\n\nThe upper side is smooth, and the decorated sides are framed by a flat\ncornice above and below. The *arula* was assembled from individual\npanels, joined together with barbotine; the joining points have been\nsmoothed with a spatula.[^1] The lively original polychromy is now\nalmost entirely gone; all that remains are traces of red pigment on the\ncornices and some black pigment on the palm tree.\n\nThis altar type, narrow and elongate in shape with scenes of fighting\nfelines, is reminiscent of *arulae* from Locri and especially from\nCaulonia, where they are found in great numbers, especially in domestic\nsettings.[^2] The *arulae* from the Achaean colony, exported to Locri or\nreproduced there from molds primarily coming from Caulonia, stand out\nfor their smaller size relative to Locrian types, and for their surface\ncolor, which in the latter is pinkish. After the Locrian types, they\nwere the most common types in Magna Graecia, where there was a notable\nreceptivity toward iconographic motifs drawn from the Ionic tradition,\noften modified to suit local tastes. In Sicily, too, beginning in the\nArchaic period, *arulae* with a zoomachia (animal combat) have been\nfound at Lipari,[^3] Agrigento, Heraclea Minoa, Gela, Monte Saraceno,\nHimera, Solunto, Zankle, Paternò, and Mozia.[^4]\n\nThis motif remained in use for a very long time with only slight\nmodifications, such as the type of animals and the composition; new\nmolds were taken from the existing ones, so that dating is especially\ndifficult if there is no accurate context for the excavation. Relying\nstrictly upon a stylistic analysis and comparison with types from\ncontexts that provide better chronological definition, the type (A 3 I)\ncan be bracketed between the end of the sixth century and the beginning\nof the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^5]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the type, fabrication technique, and polychromy, see M.\n    Rubinich, “Arule con zoomachia,” in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Barra Bagnasco 1989</span>, pp.\n    53–129, esp. pp. 53–62, and for Caulonia, <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Simonetti</span> 2002.\n\n[^2]: For the *arulae* of Caulonia, see also <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Meijden</span> 1993, pp. 38–45,\n    pls. 28, 32, 33; H.

      "description": "\nThe female head wears a *polos* with a rounded base molding and\nprojecting rim, decorated on the upper edge with small protruding nodes.\nThe thick wavy hair is divided symmetrically into two masses and pulled\nback; on top, the hair is held by a knotted ribbon whose ends fall in\nthe middle of the part. The hairstyle leaves the earlobes uncovered;\nthey are perforated for the insertion of metal earrings.\n\nThe eyes are asymmetrical and slightly sunken, and the eyelids are\ndistinctly defined. The mouth is barely half-open, with a fleshy lower\nlip and an upper lip almost touching the nose, which is narrow and\nstraight; the chin is rounded and full. Traces of polychromy, still\nidentifiable, show that the bust was originally brightly colored. The\nlower border of the *polos* is decorated with oblique lines that are\npainted purple; in the central section, though the pigment is almost\nentirely worn away, it is possible to make out a dark pink band,\ninterrupted in the center by a rosette. This decorative motif can also\nbe found in other examples, in both relief and painted versions.[^1]\n\nThis type of female bust is extensively documented in the major centers\nof Sicily, especially in the southeastern area between the fifth and\nthird centuries <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, in\nparticular in Syracuse and Agrigento, where the earliest examples are\ndocumented. The most substantial group comes from the *santuario\nrupestre* (rock-cut sanctuary of Demeter) at Agrigento, but over time\nfemale busts also spread to Morgantina, Gela, Grammichele, Himera,\nCenturipe, Butera, Scornavacche, Selinunte, Adrano, Paternò, Akrai, and\nLipari, with variants enriched by different ornaments and\nattributes.[^2]\n\nThe votive bust, derived from the simpler protome, is a distinctly\nwestern Greek creation, generally associated with Demeter and\nKore-Persephone, the tutelary deities of the island. It is interpreted\nas the abbreviated image, at once organic and abstract, of Persephone,\nan evocation of the *anados* of the goddess from the chthonic world.[^3]\nRecent studies reviewing the archaeological contexts and their\nassociations with votive offerings have given rise to new\ninterpretations, associating the bust with the *nymphe* or young bride,\nwho through marriage abandons the status of *kore* and reaches sexual\nmaturity. This crucial passage is well exemplified also in the\nmythological episode of the abduction by Hades, god of the Underworld,\nof Kore-Persephone, a model for human brides.[^4]\n\nThe bust type endured for a remarkably long time, and though it\npreserved certain constant typological characteristics—in this case\nharking back to Classical models—it also gave rise to many variants.\nSome variants followed a more traditional stylistic approach, while in\nother cases the models were developed with greater freedom and\nindependence.[^5] Similar typologies of busts are documented in contexts\nthroughout Magna Graecia, such as, for example, Fratte di Salerno, where\nthe production documents stylistic links with Syracusan terracottas but\nalso with the production of Campania and Locri; the latter was also\nclosely tied to Syracuse politically and culturally, as far back as the\nDeinomenid era.[^6] The bust type later spread through the\ncentral-Italic area, with a number of different typological and\niconographic variations, but also taking on a distinct function: it was\nless closely tied to the chthonic sphere and more often acted as an\nabbreviated portrayal of the offerer.[^7]\n\nThe busts have for some time been datable to the final decades of the\nfifth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, in part\ndue to stylistic affinities with the coinage of contemporary Syracusan\nmaster die-engravers; they have been dated as late as the second half of\nthe fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, in\nthe period of Classical revival that corresponds to a general rebirth of\nthe Greek centers in Sicily, led by the tyrant Timoleon. This age,\nfollowing the crisis of the first half of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, has generally been\ncharacterized as a return to classically inspired formal and\niconographic motifs. More recent studies, however, including those\ndevoted to the coroplastic material of Scornavacche (near Ragusa), have\nnoted the continuous utilization of the female bust of Classical origin,\nfrom the period of Dionysius up to that of Timoleon. This phenomenon is\nattributable primarily to the workshops of Syracuse, which, just at the\nbeginning of the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, held to the Classical style,\nin part as a matter of cultural identity.[^8]\n\nThe persistence over time of standardized typologies, due to\nconservatism in artistic conceptions and the reutilization of older\nmolds, resulted in the production of numerous generations of closely\nsimilar examples, which has made a detailed and accurate chronology\nproblematic. Furthermore, the Getty bust echoes certain distinctive\nfeatures of the Agrigentine busts of the second half of the fourth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, especially in\nthe rendering of Classical-style facial features, such as the full chin,\nthe small mouth with a prominent upper lip, and the triangular forehead,\nas well as in the solid articulation of the facial planes and in the\ngeneral sobriety of the expression. These characteristics are also found\nin a group of busts from Morgantina, together with the molding at the\nupper edge and ears pierced for metal earrings.[^9] The freehand\nhairstyle, with lively, puffy locks of hair, closely corresponds to the\nemerging artistic tendencies of the Early Hellenistic period; the latter\nis also found in a number of Syracusan busts.[^10]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the painted busts, see, for instance, examples in Morgantina\n    that can have the *polos* with a pink flower and the unmolded bust\n    decorated with painted panels depicting ritual or mythological\n    scenes: <span class=\"smcaps\">Bell</span> 1981, pp.\n    29–33, 140–43, nos. 106, 107, 113 (second half of the fourth\n    century, beginning of the third century <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>); <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Pautasso</span> 2007.

      "description": "\n\nThe relief is framed, at the base and at the top, by fillets supported\non each side by a perpendicular element. The back is unworked and the\ntop is slightly concave. The incomplete state of preservation of this\nartifact and the subsequent restoration attempts make it impossible to\nestablish with precision its original typology and function;\nnonetheless, it can be conjectured that the relief was set against a\nwall or in a niche; the traces of detachment in the back section support\nthis view.[^1] There are no remaining traces of the polychromy that may\noriginally have decorated this relief.\n\nThe figures were worked by hand and retouched to define the details and\nto ensure that they would adhere to the background. They project from\nthe plane in full relief, as in many other *arulae* with mythological\nsubjects found throughout Sicily and Magna Graecia during the Archaic\nperiod.[^2] In particular, the right foot of the male figure and part of\nthe corresponding leg emerge completely from the background; the torso\nadheres to the ground only on the left side; of the third figure, only\nthe outlines can be discerned, and there are no traces of the part\ncorresponding to the body.\n\nSignificant comparisons can be made with a series of figured reliefs\nfrom the sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros at Selinunte, previously linked\nto *arulae* of medium and large format, but which might also have been\npart of votive aedicules. In most of these reliefs, one sees the same\nhigh-relief technique, which endows the images with great plasticity,\nthough in these cases the figures completely fill the free space.[^3]\n\nThe present relief depicts a nude male character shown in profile,\nwalking toward the right, with his left leg striding forward; he has\nseized the hair of the central female figure with his left hand; his\nright arm must have been extending forward in order to strike her with a\nweapon, probably a sword, presumably positioned on a line with her\nchest.[^4] The female figure is characterized by a slight torsion; her\nright arm must have extended down alongside her body; the left arm was\nprobably bent toward the male character in an attempt at self-defense.\nShe is wearing a long, tight chiton that extends down to her feet; her\nhead is slightly tilted to the proper right. Her hair is brushed over\nher forehead in wavy-edged locks with no part in the middle, and hangs\ndown on either side, forming three braids suggested by little spherical\nelements. Her face is oval in shape, the mouth is small with swollen\nlips, and the nose is triangular. The large almond-shaped eyes protrude,\nwith no distinction between the eyeball and the eyelids; her\nsuperciliary arches are large, close-set, and parallel, and extend out\nto the attachment of the ears. A third figure, stepping forward with the\nright leg, was a witness to the scene.\n\nThe male character is rendered through plastic modeling, especially in\nthe legs and the strong, muscular buttocks; the torso is straight and\nelongated. The hair falls behind the shoulders in large convex braids,\nlayered horizontally.\n\nDue to a number of iconographic elements, the scene can be interpreted\nas Orestes killing his mother, Clytemnestra, in revenge for her murder\nof Orestes’ father, Agamemnon. In the absence of other identifying\nfeatures, the gesture of seizing the hair of a female character could be\nthe key to this identification, though it occurs elsewhere in mythology\nas well. Notable in this connection are two fragments that can be\nassigned to a metope from Temple C at Selinunte, with the scene of\nClytemnestra’s murder.[^5] The iconography of this metope is thought to\nreflect an Archaic motif already present in the shield band reliefs of\nPeloponnesian production, in particular from Olympia, in which, however,\nit is more often Clytemnestra’s lover, Aegisthos, who is seized by the\nhair just before the mortal blow.[^6] On the shield bands, this\niconographic scheme can also be found in scenes of battle between such\nantagonists as Zeus and Typhon or Herakles and Geras. In a plaque from\nthe Argive Heraion, datable to the middle of the seventh century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the myth of Orestes is\nreprised in a depiction that shows Clytemnestra killing Cassandra,\ngripping her by the hair with her left hand.[^7]\n\nIn the colonial setting of the Archaic period, the iconography of a\ncharacter seizing the hair or the head of a competitor or rival was also\nutilized for other subjects engaged in combat, as is documented in\narchitectural sculpture and in *arulae*; examples include Perseus and\nthe Gorgon in the metope of Temple C in Selinunte and, in coroplastic\nart, a fragmentary *arula* from Monte Saraceno, datable to the middle of\nthe sixth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in which the left arm of Perseus is raised to\ngrasp the monster’s hair, while the right arm is bent upward, holding a\nshort sword.[^8]\n\nThe scene on the Getty relief was completed by a third figure, of which\nonly the feet, the edge of a long garment, and the outline of the lower\nbody survive. The state of preservation makes it impossible to identify\nthis figure with any certainty, but for narrative consistency, it may be\nElektra, Orestes’ sister, even though the depiction of this character\nbefore the beginning of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> is uncertain. A female figure\non a bronze lamina from Olympia has been identified as Elektra, and\nBeazley has recognized her as the character behind Orestes on a\nproto-Attic krater. In the relief decorating the neck of a Cretan\n*pithos* (storage jar), possibly the first known depiction of the death\nof Clytemnestra, it has been suggested that the two female characters\nmight represent the queen’s two daughters, Elektra and Khrysothemis. In\nthe colonial milieu once again, for Metope 7 of the Heraion at Foce del\nSele near Paestum, it has been suggested, doubtfully, that the female\nfigure urging forward the sword-bearing man might be Elektra.[^9]\n\nOrestes’ matricide is a relatively uncommon theme in the Archaic period,\nand portrayals of heroes attacking female characters have been subject\nto varying interpretations.[^10] In a gilded-silver lamina, now in the\nGetty collection and datable after the middle of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, there is a similar image\nshowing the killing of Clytemnestra by Orestes: the hero, wearing a\nshort chiton, holds his mother by the hair and is about to strike a blow\nwith his sword, while she makes a gesture of supplication; at the feet\nof these two figures lies the mortally wounded Aegisthos. A southern\nItalian archaeological context has been proposed for this lamina, but\nthe general Laconian traits that can clearly be identified in this group\nmight also suggest the presence of bronze workers from mainland Greece\nin Magna Graecia.[^11] An earlier Archaic bronze relief, mentioned in\nthe previous paragraph and linked to a tripod from Olympia, is also\ncomparable; it is datable to sometime around the end of the seventh\ncentury and the first quarter of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> In that depiction, Orestes\nstrikes Clytemnestra with a sword while seizing her by the neck, as his\nmother touches his chin in a gesture of supplication; the scene also\ndepicts other figures: Aegisthos, who is trying to hide behind a\nbuilding, and perhaps Elektra or Erigone (Aegisthos’s daughter) behind\nOrestes.[^12] Another object that might attest to the diffusion of the\nOrestes myth and these iconographies in the Peloponnese, and\nparticularly in Laconia, is a stele dating from the beginning of the\nsixth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, now in\nthe Archaeological Museum of Sparta, was originally from the area of\nMagoula. It features two figures variously interpreted as Menelaus and\nHelen, Alcmaeon and Eriphyle, or Orestes a<span id=\"MacroHomeBase\"\nclass=\"anchor\"></span>nd Clytemnestra; the latter hypothesis is\nsupported by the violent gesture of the male figure as he seizes the\nwoman by the neck.[^13] This iconographic motif, therefore, was\nespecially prominent in the Peloponnese, from whence it diffused to the\nWest along with its possible ideological implications.\n\nIn the Archaic Peloponnesian context, Sparta was especially receptive to\nthemes linked to the saga of Orestes; the *Oresteia* by Stesichorus\nemphasized the religious and social traditions of that city, which lay\nunder the protection of Apollo and counted the House of Atreus among its\nlegendary rulers. In the middle of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, the Laconian city was\npursuing a “pro-Achaean” political line, in which renewed attention to\nthe myth of the Atreides (Agamemnon, Menelaus, and their offspring,\nincluding Orestes) and the recovery of Orestes’ bones served as\neffective propaganda.[^14] The emphasis on Sparta’s illustrious origins\nserved to reinforce the city’s hegemonic role in the Peloponnese and\nother areas of the Mediterranean, such as Sicily. In northwestern\nSicily, the saga of Herakles was put to similar use.[^15] Particularly\nnoteworthy is the role that Sparta played in the first half of the sixth\ncentury BC: in northwestern Sicily, the Sicilian poet Stesichorus,\nwriting his *Oresteia* at this time, underscored the Spartan setting of\nthe poem’s legendary events. It bears mentioning, too, that at the turn\nof that century, first the Knidian leader Pentathlos and later the\nSpartan prince Dorieus were in northwestern Sicily to supervise the\ncontrol of the Sicilian emporia.[^16]\n\nTo return to another colonial context in which the Atreides saga\nfigures—namely the frieze of the Heraion at the Foce del Sele, mentioned\nabove, dating from the second half of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>—a new reading of its\nfigurative program raised a hypothetical identification of episodes\nlinked to the *Oresteia* in some of the metopes. In this perspective,\nMetope 7 shows Elektra urging Orestes, armed with a sword, to commit\nmatricide; Metope 24 shows Clytemnestra holding a double-headed axe;\nMetope 19 may depict Aegisthos seated on his throne as the hero attacks\nhim; and finally, Metope 25 is variously interpreted as Orestes killing\nAegisthos or as Achilles killing Troilus.[^17] The various\ncharacterizations of Clytemnestra—“frightened and passive” in Selinunte,\nbut “combative and furious” at Foce del Sele (note here, too, the\naggressive stance of the heroes at Selinunte, such as Perseus in the\nmetope of Temple C, or Herakles in the Temple E)—have given rise to a\nnumber of hypotheses regarding the derivation of sculpture from literary\nsources, Stesichorus first and foremost. This approach has recently been\nreconsidered in a study that analyzed in a more consistent manner the\nrelationship between images and texts or “segments of stories,” with a\nspecial focus on the oral tradition, on the articulation of themes in\nsyntactic and hermeneutic terms, and on the social function of images in\nrelation to the context of origin.[^18]\n\nComplex problems are involved in tracing literary sources that could\nhave influenced sculptural cycles and in attempting to derive the\nvarious psychological articulations of the characters from these same\nsources. It is nonetheless evident that the story of Orestes would\nnecessarily take on great significance within the *polis*, given that\nthe legend is focused on the guilty responsibility of those who violate\nthe moral rules of civil society—committing crimes that strike at the\nvery *genos* (clan) to which they belong—and on the divine curse that\nstruck the entire progeny and the obligatory series of purifications\nthat was then required. In that sense, the mythological themes present\nin the monument’s decorations reflected the values and cultural\nidentities of the period and of that specific context.[^19] In this\nlight, the matricide committed by Orestes became a tragic but necessary\ncondition for freeing the family from an inheritance of guilt, but only\nthe intervention of Apollo allowed the hero, who was pursued by the\nvindictive Furies, to attain a final purification and to be readmitted\nto the community.[^20] It is interesting to note that in Column B of the\nso-called *lex sacra* of Selinunte—for which a findspot in the sanctuary\nof Zeus Meilichios, contiguous with the Malophoros sanctuary, has been\nproposed—instructions are provided for individuals concerning the\npurification rites to be performed in order to ward off the *elasteros*,\na term whose definition is uncertain but which probably means the\nvindictive fury of a murder victim. On the same sheet (Column A), Zeus\nis cited in the *epiclesis* (invocation) of Eumenes*,* with a clear\nreference to situations of contamination and purification.[^21] As part\nof this dual chthonic and purificatory role, Zeus would oversee the\ncathartic rites required of an individual who was guilty of grave crimes\n(such as the murder of a family member or a member of the same *genos*),\nin order to be freed from hostile *elasteroi* and readmitted to the\ncommunity.[^22]\n\nThe hypothesis linking the current relief with Selinunte is strictly\nconjectural, based on a reconstruction of the cultural context,\nstylistic comparison with the reliefs from the Malophoros sanctuary, and\nautoptic analysis of the clay, which seems to show the same\ncharacteristics as that from Selinunte.[^23] If this link is sustained,\nthe Malophoros sanctuary and, in particular, the area of Zeus Meilichios\nwould suggest itself as a religious and cultural context well-suited to\nhouse a depiction of Orestes, given that the Meilichios cult was\nconnected with heroic cults as well. The relief could have been placed\nwith reliefs depicting other episodes of the same story in a consecrated\nspace dedicated to the rituals of specific ancestral groups.[^24] The\nmyth of Orestes, it bears remembering, had great significance within the\ncultural and religious milieu of Selinunte; the theme is also present in\na metope of Temple C in Selinunte, identified as an *Apollonion*. Here,\nthe treatment of the myth in the frieze appears to have taken into\naccount both the genealogy of the protagonist heroes, all of them\nintimately connected to Dorian and Peloponnesian contexts, and the\ngeographic setting of their deeds. This criterion served as the tie\nbetween the metope of Perseus and the Gorgon and that of Herakles and\nthe Cercopes (mischievous forest dwellers), perhaps linking the metope\nof the Dioscuri with the metope with Orestes and Clytemnestra that\nconcluded the frieze on the left. Perseus is, in fact, the hero who\nstands at the root of the Atreides family tree, while Orestes marks its\nend. At the same time, the geographic setting of the narratives involves\nboth Argos and Sparta.[^25] It seems to be no accident that it was\nprecisely Argos in the Archaic period that exerted a powerful influence\nupon Nisaean (mainland) Megara, where, according to Pausanias, the last\nking was Hyperion, a brother of Orestes. In this sense, Selinous\n(Selinunte), a subcolony of Nisaean Megara, affirmed its civic identity\nin part through an explicit reference to the memorable places and the\norigins of the community, in Argos and Sparta, in which the saga of the\nAtreides played a foundational role.[^26]\n\nIt is through this thematic thread that the story of Orestes, drawn from\nthe religious and cultural patrimony of the homeland, must then have\nconstituted an ethical point of reference for the new *polis* as\nwell.[^27] Orestes, who in the wake of the matricide was obliged to\nundertake a process of purification at the behest of Apollo (the deity\nwho oversaw family relations), would find an appropriate place in the\nMalophoros sanctuary, in particular given that, among other things,\nindividual groups of aristocratic families seem to have had special ties\nto the Meilichios cult and to the cult of ancestral spirits, as\npreviously noted in the context of the *lex sacra*.[^28] In addition,\nmore recent studies have conjectured that the Atreides were connected to\nSelinous in part through the figure of Iphigenia, Orestes’ unfortunate\nsister, who after her sacrifice by Agamemnon was transformed by Artemis\ninto Hekate. According to Stesichorus in his *Oresteia* and the\n*Catalogue of Women* attributed to Hesiod, Hekate was the bride of\nHades.[^29] Iphigenia, thus associated with Hekate, would then have been\nthe subject of a chthonic cult—also linked to nuptial rites—that was\npracticed in the enclosure at the eastern end of the Malophoros\nsanctuary, outside of the *temenos*.[^30] In this case, as with the\nMalophoros sanctuary and perhaps also the sacred area of the\nMeilichios—whose existence is also hypothesized in Nisaean Megara—the\ncult of Iphigenia, a constant mythical element of the Megarean world,\nultimately expressed a reprisal of the cults found in the Greek\nhomeland.[^31] Indeed, in Nisaean Megara, in the area around the agora,\nthere was a *heroön* of Iphigenia founded, according to legend, by\nAgamemnon before the expedition to Troy: according to one version of the\nmyth, the hapless girl’s sacrifice took place in Megara and, as\nmentioned above, the last king of the city was a son of Agamemnon and a\nbrother of Orestes.[^32]\n\nIt would hardly suffice to construct an interpretive model that\ncatalogued exact comparisons in mythological and cultural milieu between\nhomelands and colonies without taking into consideration the complex\nprocesses by which the myth was redefined *in loco*. But it is clear\nthat the reprisal of the homeland cults in the *apoikia* (colonies)\nunderscored ethnic, cultural, and political affiliations with the land\nof origin; this tie was especially strong in the colonies of\nMegara.[^33]\n\nA stylistic analysis of the Getty relief shows the coexistence of\nelements of diverse derivations, which makes it problematic to place the\npiece in a clearly defined current. The same holds true for much of\nsixth-century sculpture from Sicily. The scene appears to be\nwell-balanced in the composition of solids and voids, and the figures,\naligned in a paratactic rhythm, seem to defy that spatial conception,\nobservable in both Archaic metopes and *arulae*, according to which\ncharacters are imprisoned within the bounds of the figured field.[^34]\n\nThe coroplast made a special effort to attenuate Clytemnestra’s frontal\nview, placing the feet on different planes and tilting the head toward\nthe viewer, to overcome the traditional Archaic view of front and\nprofile, though the result is not entirely persuasive and the figure\nstill appears slightly disorganized.[^35] The characters, in almost full\nrelief, jut sharply out of the background creating a well-defined\nchiaroscuro. It is easy to perceive the coroplast’s skill in defining\nvolumes, such as the round plastic masses in the lower part of the male\nbody and in the articulation of the knee.[^36] Although the\ninterdependence noted between metopes and *arulae*, as discussed above,\nis not well understood and may appear somewhat forced, it should be\npointed out that, in the milieu of Selinunte, there is evidence of a\nstylistic affinity between the two.[^37] Orestes, for example, is\nreminiscent of the Perseus in the metope of Temple C, though the\nproportions of legs to torso are inverted, while the tubular arms, which\nare proportionately too short and lack muscular definition, are tapered\nand slender in comparison with the legs; Orestes’ small hands with\nstylized fingers are reminiscent of those in certain figures of the\nso-called small metopes at Selinunte, as for example in the Delphic\nTriad.[^38] Additionally, the head of Clytemnestra presents a number of\nstylistic affinities with figures in the small metopes, especially in\nthe cranial structure and a number of other details, such the small\nmouth and the large globular eyes, undefined in their details, which are\nalso present in the figure of Apollo in the Delphic Triad.[^39] The\ncompact hair—with an undulating border, no center part, combed over a\nlow forehead, and falling to the shoulders in a compact mass of curls,\nlayered horizontally—recurs in the figures from an Archaic relief from\nSelinunte (Casa del Viaggiatore), such as the figure in the small metope\nof the Quadriga of Apollo. Some of these elements can also be found in\nsmall bronzes of Laconian inspiration imported in the West, which could\nhave served as a source of stylistic inspiration for coroplastic\nproduction.[^40] It is the metal objects that seem to determine the\nPeloponnesian formal koine that emerged in the wake of an artistic\nlanguage developed by Sparta, and later by Corinth; this language is\nrecognizable, for instance, in the solid, vigorous modeling, in the\nplasticity of the gestures, and in the clear, incisive outline.[^41]\n\nFor the figure of Orestes, for instance, it is useful to refer to\nLaconian bronzes, such as a statuette of Hermes, datable to the middle\nof the sixth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\nThis work shows a comparable definition of the calf muscles and\narticulation of the knee, in contrast with the flat, elongated torso.\nThe latter would be functional in the case of the small bronze\nstatuette, facilitating the figure’s attachment to an object such as a\ntripod.[^42] The general composition of the figure and the large,\nundefined globular eyes hark back to characteristics of Corinthian art\nthat are readily identified in the coroplastic art of Selinunte as well\nin some heads of Temple C.[^43] In this confluence—a distinctive\nsynthesis of varied cultural and stylistic features—traits belonging to\nthe eastern Aegean milieu do not seem out of place: especially the\nflattened, elongated torso, which seems to contrast with the massive\nlower limbs and rotund buttocks in the Orestes figure.[^44]\n\nThe Getty relief displays a stylistic language in which various\ninfluences, mostly Corinthian, integrate into a formal autonomous\nexpression with references to the cultural roots of the homeland, which\nin the dynamic colonial setting find a fertile context for new\nelaborations. Religious ties to the homeland were affirmed—with a\ncertain adaptation to the local context—through an iconographic\nconservatism.[^45]\n\nFor its figurative layout, compositional solutions, and stylistic\ncharacteristics, the relief seems to fit chronologically in the third\nquarter of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the hypothesis that reliefs were either turned to a wall or\n    embedded in a wall, see (for the Malophoros sanctuary) <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Gabrici</span> 1927, coll. 118–19,\n    181–82; and <span class=\"smcaps\">Tusa</span> 1984,\n    pp. 124–25*.* Terracotta *pinakes* and votive reliefs are well\n    documented in the sanctuaries of Selinunte and in other Demeter\n    sanctuaries; see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Marconi</span> 2009, pp. 200–202,\n    for the stone votive relief depicting Persephone’s abduction, which\n    may have been displayed in the propylon of the sanctuary.

The relationship between iconographies on\n    shields and a number of *arulae* from Selinunte was also emphasized\n    in connection with the recurring motif of the quadriga, which is\n    found both on *arulae* from the Malophoros sanctuary, and also in\n    the metope of Temple C.

The similarities between the materials found in\n    Selinunte and those offered at Olympia suggest that metopes from the\n    major religious centers of the homeland could, in some cases, have\n    constituted a reference model, especially for the aristocratic\n    classes of the Sicilian and Magna Graecian *poleis*. This would\n    still be consistent with the dynamic local re-elaboration in the\n    representation of myth that was evolving in Archaic Sicily.

Brugnone, “Una laminetta iscritta da Selinunte,”\n    *SicArch* 30 (1997), pp. 121–30. According to another\n    interpretation, the sacred law of Selinunte and the purification\n    rites were not connected to bloodshed: see A. Giuliani, “La\n    purificazione degli *elasteroi* nella legge sacra di Selinunte,”\n    *Aevum* 72 (1998), pp. 68–89; and C. Antonetti and S.

Di Martino, “Omicidio,\n    contaminazione, purificazione: Il caso della lex sacra di\n    Selinunte,” *ASNP* 8 (2006), pp. 305–49.\n\n[^22]: Both Myskos and Euthydamos, mentioned in the *lex sacra,* aside\n    from being identified as local heroes, are interpreted as\n    personifications of two concepts bound up, respectively, with an\n    impure, negative situation and a positive situation. For this\n    interpretation, see <span class=\"smcaps\">Curti and\n    Van Bremen</span> 1999, pp. 21–33. The authors place the\n    tomb-*heroön* of Myskos in certain structures of the Meilichios\n    sanctuary previously studied by Gabrici, and interpret the two\n    terracotta cylinders beneath the foundation blocks as containers of\n    the offerings to the Tritopatores (a trio of gods, currently little\n    understood). For the meaning of *elasteroi* in connection with the\n    mythical model of Orestes, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Marconi</span> 2007, pp. 207–9.\n\n[^23]: See, for instance, the comparable clay in reliefs of certain\n    local provenience in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Gabrici</span> 1927, pls. XXXI,\n    nos. 3 and 6; XXXII no. 3; and XXXIV, no. 4. It should be noted that\n    the *lex sacra* became part of the Getty collection in 1981, the\n    year in which some distinctive twinned stelai from the sanctuary of\n    Zeus Meilichios were also acquired (inv. 81.AA.135, 81.AA.136,\n    81.AA.137, 81.AA.138, 81.AA.139a-d); this coincidence in dates may\n    reinforce the hypothesis that the current object is also from\n    Selinunte.\n\n[^24]: On the pertinence and significance of the subject in the\n    Selinunte area, see also <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Østby</span> 1996, pp. 31–33.\n    According to a hypothesis that merits further attention, a\n    fragmentary terracotta relief from the Malophoros sanctuary might be\n    a portrayal of the same subject: an armed male character faces a\n    figure looking to the right; of a third character, perhaps\n    Aegisthos, there remain only scant traces. If this identification\n    holds, it would be further evidence of the presence in Selinunte of\n    an ancient iconographic tradition linked to the hero; see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Gabrici</span> 1927, coll. 188–89,\n    pl. XXX, no. 1. On the hypothesis of a cult of Zeus Meilichios\n    undertaken by *genoi* or *patriai* (birth or caste groups), see\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Gabrici</span> 1927, coll.\n    403–5; and A. Brugnone, cited in n. 21 above.\n\n    Pausanias also mentions, along the sacred road to Eleusis, an altar\n    of Zeus Meilichios where Theseus is said to have purified himself\n    after killing his cousin Sinis in the course of his adventures\n    (Pausanias 1.37.4). Sanctuaries dedicated to the purifying god were\n    always situated near burial areas, as was the case in Selinunte; see\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Gabrici</span> 1927, coll.\n    403–5; for the cult of Zeus Meilichios, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Zuntz</span> 1971, pp. 101–4; G.\n    Sfameni Gasparro, “Politica, religione e culti,” in *<span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Lo stile severo</span>* 1990, pp.\n    43–54; G. Manganaro, “Mondo religioso greco e mondo indigeno in\n    Sicilia,” in <span class=\"smcaps\">Antonetti</span>\n    1997, pp. 71–82. See N. Cusumano, “Zeus Meilichios,” *Mythos* 3\n    (1991**)**, pp. 19–47; the author, after examining the evidence on\n    the cult of Zeus Meilichios in the various areas of Greece and the\n    Greek colonies, conjectured that a *genos* (descent, stock) or a\n    *thiasos* (cult retinue) could procure a sacralized space in the\n    rock for its purposes, carve a niche in it, and in that niche\n    inscribe a dedication, as seen, for instance, in Thera and Cyrene.\n    If that were the case, it is possible that the current relief might\n    have enjoyed a similar placement in the Meilichios sanctuary at\n    Selinunte.\n\n[^25]: See C.

It may be that large-production terracottas can also\n    provide significant evidence relative to phenomena of cultural\n    conservatism and iconographic persistence, which are so\n    characteristic of the artistic models used in the western Greek\n    cities; an overall analysis of the reliefs and *arulae* from\n    Malophoros and a general reconsideration of the sanctuary, with a\n    broader view of its contextual and cult milieu, could test this\n    hypothesis.

The mouth of Clytemnestra, with small, fleshy, horizontal\n    lips, does not present the Archaic smile and seems like a distant\n    heritage of the sub-Daedalic tradition, but the face, inscribed in\n    an oval, belongs to the realm of Archaic sculpture; for this aspect,\n    see G.

      "description": "\nThe female figure is standing; she must originally have stood on a base\nthat has since been lost. The left leg is extended forward and the right\narm is raised, with the palm of the hand, with notably elongated\nfingers, turned toward the viewer. The left arm, which is slightly bent,\nextends down parallel to the body; the left hand gathers the *paryphe*\n(woven border) of the chiton. The figure’s long, clinging chiton has\nsleeves fastened at the elbow with circular clasps; it ruffles across\nthe torso in small, delicate folds. Above the chiton, crosswise, lies a\nred himation, which falls between the breasts and drapes down the right\nside in a long strip; part of it is now lost. A good portion of the\ndrapery covers the right half of the torso and, owing to the raised arm,\nfalls in a curve that appears a bit incongruous; a strip of dark blue\nadorns the hem of the chiton and runs sideways across the torso. The\nfolds of the chiton, in the lower half of the body, are indicated by\nmeans of fine radial incisions that converge toward the clutching\nhand.[^1]\n\nThe hairstyle consists of four rows of small globular curls, arranged in\nan arc across the forehead (a fine clay border sticks out from the first\nrow of ringlets); they fall on either side of the neck in two compact\nmasses. Set atop the head is a *stephane* with a semicircular border,\nwhich accords perfectly with the regular oval of the face and the\ncurving line of the hairstyle. The gently smiling face is broad; the\ncheekbones are emphasized, the chin is full and slightly jutting; the\nmouth is broad and well designed with fleshy lips; the nose is wide at\nthe base, with a flat dorsal ridge. The eyes are almond-shaped, without\nany indication of iris; they are elongated and the superciliary arches,\nregular and highlighted in relief, merge directly with the root of the\nnose.\n\nThe broad sickle-shaped wings are inserted directly into the back. They\nrise over the figure on each side, and the various layers of feathers,\narranged in a fan shape, were chromatically punctuated by red pigment\nagainst a black background; these colors are now largely lost. The back\nof the statue is sketchily modeled, with an indication of buttocks, but\nit too must originally have been painted, as shown by the traces of\npigment on wings and buttocks.[^2]\n\nSupported by the female figure, the *thymiaterion* rests on a short,\ntubular base atop the *stephane*. It is composed of a low bowl, turned\non a potter’s wheel, with a vertical lip, covered with a tall,\nbell-shaped lid that is perforated with a line of seven lozenge-shaped\nopenings; above these are four smaller circular openings. A hand-modeled\ndove with a fan-shaped tail and spread wings forms the handle of the\nlid.\n\nThe female figure that supports the *thymiaterion* is Nike, the deity\nwho consecrates victory in athletic, musical, poetic, and military\ncompetitions and who officiates at sacrificial rites. She is here\ndepicted in keeping with the typology of the Late Archaic *korai*.[^3]\n\nThe origin of the *thymiaterion* and of the custom of burning incense in\nsacred rituals can be sought in the East. With the spread of\norientalizing fashions from the Near East, both the custom and its\nrelated objects became more common in the Greek world, probably through\nthe mediation of Cyprus. In the West, censing is documented both in\nfunerary and votive deposits, particularly those correlated with the\nchthonic religious context and the worship of Aphrodite.[^4]\n\nThe caryatid-style *thymiaterion*, in particular, is documented from the\nend of the eighth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, both in the eastern regions\nand in Greece.[^5] It was between the sixth and the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> that this type of\n*thymiaterion* seems to have spread most extensively. Generally the\nfigure holds the cup directly on its head, or on a tall support. The\narms are brought forward, sometimes bearing a votive object; this\ncompositional solution conferred greater lightness on the whole, as\nattested as well by a number of examples in bronze, from Delphi, Sicyon,\nSparta, and, in the West, from the Etruscan territory (especially the\nVulci area) and from Magna Graecia.[^6]\n\nTerracotta caryatid *thymiateria* may have been derived from metal\nprototypes; this is suggested by comparison with the *korai* or Nikai\nfigures utilized as mirror handles and in candelabra, widespread in\nGreece, Magna Graecia, Sicily, and especially Etruria in the sixth and\nfifth centuries <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^7]\nParticularly, a figure topping a candelabrum dating from the end of the\nsixth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> offers a\nuseful comparison for the Getty’s Nike in the pose, the gesture of the\nhand, the clothing, and the general configuration.[^8]\n\nFor the present Nike, the reliance upon a metal prototype is attested in\npart by the shape of the censer and above all by the cover, with its\nlozenge-shaped fretwork designed to allow the aromatic smoke to escape;\nthis type was probably borrowed from the eastern Aegean and is also\nfound in Greece, Magna Graecia, and Sicily.[^9] The rigidity of the\ntreatment of the textile folds, which are flattened and clinging to the\nbody, and the sickle-shaped wings are also found in small bronzes\ndepicting sphinxes and Gorgons; this too suggests the possible\nderivation from metal prototypes for the Getty’s figure.[^10] Two\nterracotta pieces from Sicily offer significant comparisons: a\n*thymiaterion kore*, datable to 520 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, comes from a *pithos* that\nwas destroyed by the foundations of a wall on the Acropolis of Gela (it\nmay have belonged to a sacred building). This *kore* is depicted with a\nchiton *poderes* (reaching the feet) and a short transverse himation,\nand its head supports a cup with bobbin handles. The second piece,\ndating from 530 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, and\nnow in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, is from an unknown archaeological\ncontext, but may also be assignable to Gela: it stands on a rectangular\nbase, bears a flower on its breast, and carries on its head a cup, only\nthe bottom of which is preserved.[^11]\n\nAlso in Selinunte, and in particular in the Malophoros Sanctuary, there\nare probably attestations of terracotta caryatid-style *thymiateria*: a\nnumber of examples of *korai*, datable to around 530–20 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, hold on their heads\ncontainers that may be censers.[^12]\n\nThe motif of the bird used as a cover handle is fairly common. It is\nfound for instance in a silver *thymiaterion*, now in the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art in New York, datable to the end of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; it is also attested during\nthe same period in a number of types of bucchero hydriai and oinochoai\nwith dome covers. Doves were also used extensively on Etruscan\n*thymiateria* of the Hellenistic period.[^13]\n\nThe dove, a bird sacred to Aphrodite, can by transference accompany\nother deities as well and can allude to love and the fleeting nature of\nlife, especially when it is present in funerary contexts. In Magna\nGraecia and Sicily, dove figurines are more commonly found in connection\nwith the chthonic and funerary sphere, as attested, for example, by a\nnumber of examples from Agrigento.[^14]\n\nWithin the typology of caryatid-shaped *thymiateria*, the figures of\n*korai* seem to prevail in the Late Archaic period; they are also\ndepicted in the type of the *peplophoros* bearing an offering, but\nimages of Nike are more rare.[^15]\n\nAs the officiating deity and guarantor of the rites following a victory,\nNike with her *thymiaterion* appears frequently in Attic red-figure\nvase-painting of the period between 490 and 460 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, where she is also depicted\nwith other attributes linked to the cult or chthonic sphere, such as\nphialai, paterae, oinochoai, or torches. In particular, Nike with\n*thymiaterion* became a favorite subject of the Berlin Painter and the\nPan Painter and his circle, who painted numerous lekythoi intended for\nSicilian markets.[^16]\n\nThe connection of Nike with the *thymiaterion* is also documented in\nApulian vase-painting from the fourth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; for the entire Hellenistic\nperiod, the Nike was a common iconographic motif in the decorative\nrepertory of jewels, ceramics, and terracottas. Shortly after the middle\nof the fourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>,\nAthenian sources mention a *thymiaterion* dedicated to Athena Nike.[^17]\n\nFrom the Late Archaic period onward, images of winged figures became\nincreasingly more common, both in Greece and in the West, especially in\narchitectonic decoration.[^18]\n\nNumerous fragments of terracotta statues of Nikai from the Late Archaic\nperiod have been discovered at Olympia, some of which were mounted as\nacroteria on buildings located on the terrace of the *thesauroi*\n(treasuries). These fragments constitute significant evidence of the\ndiffusion in this context of the winged figure in a particular\nstance—running and about to take off from the earth—that would come to\nrepresent a visual and conceptual link between the terrestrial and the\ndivine spheres. Olympia, the city that symbolized athletic competition,\nhad a special relationship with Nike: Pausanias stated that there was an\naltar dedicated to the winged goddess there, and she was depicted on the\nstaters of Elis, where Olympia is situated, in 490 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span><span id=\"MyEditingPlace\"\nclass=\"anchor\"></span>[^19]\n\nDuring the same period, in the Greek West as well, the image of Nike was\nwidely used in architectural decoration. Among the numerous examples are\nthe fragmentary sima from Paestum; a Nike acroterion from Locri; the\nfragmentary statue in Karlsruhe bought on the antiquities market and\ntentatively assigned to either Gela or Camarina; the statue of Nike from\nthe Syracusan Athenaion; and two terracotta Nike acroteria from Taranto,\nall belonging to the Late Archaic period (first half of the fifth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC).</span>[^20] From a\nvotive deposit on the Acropolis of Gela, close to the Athenaion, comes a\nfragmentary bust in terracotta with a garment decorated with a rosette\nand meander motif; due to the musculature and the attachment of the\nshoulders, it could be identified as a Nike. Another Nike dressed in a\nshort chiton and a himation appears in relief on a fragment of\narchitectural decoration, now in Copenhagen and perhaps originally from\nTaranto<span class=\"smcaps\">.</span>[^21]\n\nThe winged figure is recurrent in the coin types of Catania, Syracuse,\nGela, and Camarina. In the last-named colony, possibly beginning in 461\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, silver litrae were\nminted showing a winged figure with her right hand raised and the left\nhand gathering her clothing, in accordance with iconography previously\nseen in vase-painting.[^22] In Syracuse, the mother city of Camarina,\nNike also appears on tetradrachms that can be dated to 480 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> On these coins, as well as\non late-fifth-century decadrachms signed by Euainetos and Kimon, and\nCatanian tetradrachms dating after 480 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, she holds a crown of laurel\naloft above a chariot. In tetradrachms from Gela dating to 440–430 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, a flying Nike crowns a\nman-headed bull.[^23]\n\nThe Nike image, which, as noted, became increasingly common both in\nGreece and in the West, especially during the first half of the fifth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> (and in\nparticular following the Battle of Marathon), has been interpreted not\nonly as a potent emblem of victory but as evoking the very presence of\nthe deity on a battlefield or in an athletic contest. From a historical\nand political perspective, therefore, the journey of the image of Nike\noffers interesting insight into the determination to import into the\nWest a message of Athenian triumph over the Persians, which in Sicily\ncame to correspond with victory of the Greeks over the Punic element.\nThus the winged figure could come to acquire a specific programmatic and\nideological value, an eloquent image to seal the affiliation of the\ncolonial cities with the Greek identity, of which Athens constituted in\nthose years the highest expression.[^24] Even Nike’s pose should be seen\nas connected with her role as a messenger of salvation and celebrant of\nvictory: in vase-painting and in coins, in addition to being depicted in\nflight or running in a distinctive backward-looking pose, Nike most\noften shows her arm raised in a gesture of salutation or identifies the\nvictor in an athletic contest.[^25]\n\nStylistically, in general composition, in the type of clothing, and in\nthe treatment of the hairstyle, the Getty figure echoes the type of the\nAttic *kore* dating from the Late Archaic period, which is extensively\ndocumented in the coroplastic art of Sicily, though the type of flat,\ncurved wings is an Archaic reminiscence.[^26]\n\nIt is in the last third of the sixth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> that Attic-derived\nstylistic tendencies began to spread to Sicily in the coroplastic\nproduction, perhaps through imported molds or by the emigration of\nartists and coroplasts of Attic origin. In this period, in fact, the\nSiceliote workshops related to the Siceliote *poleis* had already\nelaborated specific and distinctive connotations though the assimilation\nof the stylistic influence from the Greek world, especially from Attica.\nWithin this dynamic production, the coroplasts found their most vital\nand original life force in these relationships, by turns resistant and\nreceptive, between the foreign models on the one hand and local\ncontributions on the other.[^27] Close comparisons for the Getty Nike\ncan be found in Selinunte, where a number of statuettes of *korai* from\nthe Malophoros Sanctuary, dating from between the sixth and fifth\ncenturies <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, attest the\nsame typology and comparable iconographic details, such as the long,\nnarrow chiton with the lower hem draping between the feet; the use of an\nincised line for the rendering of the folds; the pleated effect of the\nchiton folds on the torso; the flat transverse hem of the himation; the\nlong fold that falls along the right hip; and the modeled back section.\nThe facial type, too—characterized by the full oval shape and the soft,\ncontinuous surface, with almond-shaped eyes, broad, arched eyebrows, a\nwide nose, and elongated, distinct lips—associated with a hairstyle\nconsisting of dense, small ringlets, seems to have been used in\nSelinunte for various types of statuettes from the same period. In\nparticular, the bulbous eyes, without distinction from the eyelids (here\nendowed with a regular almond shape), was already an iconographic\npeculiarity of sculpture in Sicily from the Archaic period.[^28] In\nSicily, this type of face, which seems to mark a transition from the\nArchaic style toward the Severe style, also became more widespread in\nthe broader southern area extending between Gela, Agrigento, and\nCamarina. The type may have been elaborated from an Attic model\nintroduced as part of the intense cultural and economic exchange between\nAttica and this area. Some comparisons can be detected at Gela in the\nstructure of the face and the hairstyle; in these it bears resemblance\nto the figure of Eos in a scene with Kephalos, on the altar found in\nBosco Littorio near the Archaic emporium at the foot of Gela’s Acropolis\nand datable between 490 and 480 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^29] The full, fleshy face\nof the Nike can also be compared to the protome of the “Blank Eye Type”\n(according to Uhlenbrock’s classification), identified particularly with\nthe Gela area in the last quarter of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and characterized by similar\nfeatures, though there it was combined with a different treatment of the\nhairstyle and headdress.[^30] Also comparable is a protome in the Museo\nCivico Castello Ursino in Catania, dating from between 530 and 520 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and assignable to Camarina,\nthough the facial features reflect a distinct Ionian inspiration. One\ncan see the assimilation of Attic influence in the regular, slightly\noblique eyes; the fluid outline of the face, slightly heavy in the chin;\nand the hairstyle with dense waves that almost form tiny spheres.[^31]\nThis hairstyle can also be found in the Tarentine coroplastic production\nthat, as early as the Archaic period, showed characteristics similar to\nproduction in a number of areas of Sicily.[^32] Another head of a\nstatuette—assignable to the earliest phase of settlement in Castiglione\n(Ragusa), which fell under the sway of Camarina—is datable to the end of\nthe sixth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> In\nthe hairstyle, eye shape, treatment of the mouth, and continuous\nmodeling, this head can be linked to the same formal tradition as the\nCastello Ursino protome, mentioned above.[^33]\n\nSome terracotta heads from Agrigento also clearly attest to a\ntransformation of the formal and stylistic language within coroplastic\nproduction at the end of the sixth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, especially in the\nhairstyle and the soft, rounded rendering of the face, which is somewhat\npuffy; and in the elongation of the eyes, which are emphasized by the\nhigh superciliary arch. These features were characteristic of local\nproduction and remained constant over the course of the fifth century,\nin marble sculpture as well as terracotta.[^34]\n\nThe same stylistic trend influenced by the Attic strain in the Sicilian\nartistic production is also traceable in the same period in some marble\nsculptures, in which the Ionic elements begin to diminish.[^35] The\nderivation of the *thymiaterion* Nike from an Attic model appears\nespecially evident when looking at the head of a terracotta *kore* from\nthe Athenian Acropolis, which has a very similar construction of the\nface and facial features, or the terracotta *korai* from the Kerameikos\ncemetery in Athens, dating back to the first decades of the fifth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and\ncharacterized by the same definition of the eyes, without eyelids.[^36]\n\nAlso, a comparison with more sculptural models—such as the Athenian\nmarble *korai* from the very early fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, characterized primarily by a\nsharp attenuation of the Ionian formal traits, identifiable as the\nalmost horizontal orientation of the eyes, the faint smile, and the\ncontinuous line devoid of any accentuated chiaroscuro\nmodulations—reiterates an intonation that is clearly analogous to that\nof the Getty Nike.[^37]\n\nThe findings may be summarized as follows: (1) The Nike seems to be\nlinked to a colonial setting that had, between the end of the sixth\ncentury and the first two decades of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, close, intense ties with\nAttica, such as Gela, Camarina, or Selinunte. (2) In stylistic terms,\nthe characteristics of the face seem to be linked to a type of Attic\ninfluence found in the entire area from Selinunte in the east to\nCamarina in the west; the area of diffusion also included Agrigento and,\nespecially, Gela.[^38] (3) Gela, in particular, between 500 and 470\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> appears to have been\nthe prime recipient of Attic vases with depictions of Nike. The\ndiffusion of these items was probably also linked to ideological and\npropagandistic factors, and the marked interest in Atticism in the\ncolony in the fifth century.\n\nThe lack of findspot greatly limits the frame of reference, particularly\nin regard to the significance of the object’s final resting place,\nwhether funerary, domestic, or votive.[^39]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: According to analysis by the Getty’s Antiquities Conservation\n    Department, the form that appears to be a snake’s head coming out of\n    the hem of the chiton across the bust is simply incrustation. It\n    originated from root casing; there are a number of such “snakelike”\n    casings all over the figure, which are hard to discern with the\n    naked eye.\n\n[^2]: On the use of polychromy in statuary and the coroplastic art, see\n    V.Manzelli, *La policromia nella statuaria greca arcaica* (Rome,\n    1994), pp. 135–36, 261, nos. 90–93, 207; on the polychromy of\n    Archaic sculpture in particular, see V.

      "description": "\n\nThe group depicts Odysseus, or one of his companions, fleeing from the\ngrotto of the Cyclops Polyphemos by hiding beneath the belly of a ram.\nThe animal is rendered in a somewhat stylized manner conceived to be\ncovered by the white paste, with a cylindrical body and short stick\nlegs, while the head reveals more defined modeling, especially in the\nrendering of the twisted horns and the muzzle.[^1] Of the male figure,\nonly part of the head is shown, projecting from between the animal’s\nfront legs, with no indication of a body, nor of the arms that in many\nother depictions of this subject appear gripping the animal’s back. The\nman’s face is oval, with globular eyes; the hair is arranged in an arch\nover the forehead, with small globular ringlets.[^2] The animal’s fleece\nis rendered with a milk-of-lime paste applied to the surface of the\nclay, then smoothed with a tool. The piece is hollow and low-fired.\n\nThis Homeric episode, recounted in the ninth book of the *Odyssey*, is\none of the most recurrent themes in Greek figurative culture. Beginning\nin the Orientalizing period and especially in the Archaic period, the\nscene was frequently rendered not only within the iconographic repertory\nof Attic vases but also in fictile reliefs, appliqués, and bronze\ntripods.[^3]\n\nAccording to literary tradition, Sicily was the homeland of the\nCyclopes, but the topography of the places described in the Homeric text\nare still very much subject to debate.[^4] Nevertheless, the hero and\nhis wanderings were a very common and lively subject within the culture\nof the colonies of Magna Graecia and Sicily.[^5]\n\nIt is possible that a cult of the Greek hero may have arisen as early as\nthe Archaic period in the eastern area of Sicily, as seems to be\nsuggested by the discovery of an *arula* from Megara Hyblaea, dating\nfrom the third quarter of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> with a scene of Odysseus\nescaping from the cave of Polyphemos.[^6]\n\nThe Getty statuette, which is reported to have come from Sicily, finds\nits closest comparison with a terracotta now in the Ny Carlsberg\nGlyptotek in Copenhagen, which is presumed to come originally from\nBarrafranca (Enna) and is likewise datable to the end of the sixth\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^7] Though\nobjective evidence is lacking, the close analogies between the two\npieces would support the hypothesis that they shared a common\narchaeological context.\n\nThese two statuettes are closely comparable with a number of works in\nbronze: an appliqué with the hero beneath the ram, dating from the\nsecond half of the sixth century and originally from Delphi; and the\nhandle fixtures—of Laconian inspiration—with rams belonging to bronze\nhydriai dating from the middle of the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, but also found in the\nCorinthian milieu after 550 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^8]  \n\n<br />\n\n#### Appendix\n\nThe piece has been subjected to UV light testing, which did not reveal\nany irregularities.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: In the Archaic period, depictions of rams are often associated\n    with Odysseus; see A.

Heisserer, “An Archaic Greek Bronze\n    Ram-Figurine,” *ArchCl* 41 (1989), pp. 383–90.\n\n[^2]: The face of Odysseus, especially in the rendering of the eyes and\n    hair, shows distinctive Archaic characteristics.\n\n[^3]: A complete bibliography on the theme as it appears in various\n    artistic genres can be found in B.

      "description": "\nThe statuette depicts a young female musician who, with a cadenced step,\nwalks toward the viewer’s right. With her right hand, she plucks an\ninstrument carried on her left shoulder; given its small size, the\ninstrument can be identified as a “cradle kithara.” Her weight is on her\nright leg, which steps forward, while her left leg is slightly bent and\ncrosses behind her. Her torso is flexed strongly backward, as is her\nhead, which also turns to the proper right in a pose of ecstasy. The\nface is round, the cheeks are full, and her expression is smiling; her\ntresses, parted into two bands on her forehead, are drawn back onto the\nnape of her neck in a broad cluster of hair, falling in compact locks\nonto her shoulders.[^1] Following her sinuous movement, her long,\nhigh-waisted chiton clings to her body; emphasizing her prominent\nbreasts and buttocks, the garment falls in broad, soft folds. The base\nis an irregularly shaped oval, on the left side of which is a vent hole.\n\nThe figure is characterized by a pronounced flexing of the torso and by\na dynamic rhythm that develops progressively from the raised left heel\ntoward the top of the figure. This sort of weighting is found also in\nmany figures of females dancers discovered among the funerary deposits\nof the Early Hellenistic period from Magna Graecia and Sicily, where\ndance and music played a prominent role in Dionysian cult contexts as\nwell in rites of passage from childhood to adolescence.[^2]\n\nDancers and female musicians with lyres and kitharas are particularly\nwell represented in the funerary deposits of Taranto, Lipari, and\nCenturipe, generally dating from the third century or second century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^3] Such figures are\npresented in poses similar to that of the Getty’s dancer, that is,\ncharacterized by sinuous rhythms and by a new spatial construction of\nthe figure developed in coeval statuary of the Early Hellenistic\nperiod.[^4] The presence of music in the funerary context is well\ndocumented by finds of these instruments in tomb contexts in Athens and\nin funerary deposits in Locri, Taranto, and Paestum in Magna\nGraecia.[^5] Such dancer and musician typologies are also well attested\nin the Hellenistic period at Priene, Myrina, Pergamon, and Cyrene, where\nthey were produced up until the first century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; the latter cities were\ninvolved in an especially intense exchange of motifs and iconographies\nwith Magna Graecia in which, at least in the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, Taranto seems to have played\nan especially active role.[^6]\n\nThe presence of the cradle kithara—a typically female instrument due to\nits small size and its high-pitched sound—in combination with the\ntheatrical type of chiton—high-belted, light, with short sleeves, which\nin other typologies may be accompanied by a himation wrapped around the\narms or on the hips—can be traced to the iconography of the Muse, which\nseems to have been the inspiration for this figure.[^7] In gems as well\nas terracottas, it is possible to find a number of comparisons for the\nMuse playing an instrument, though the schemes tend to be different: in\nfact, it is more common to see the instrument carried on the torso or to\none side, rather than over the shoulder. Sometimes the kithara is set on\na small pillar, or the figure might be resting a foot on a rocky rise,\nor playing in a seated position.[^8] The scheme of this statue, with the\nkithara set on the left shoulder—a position that accentuates the arched\nback and markedly emphasizes the pelvis, creating an almost grotesque\ndeformation of the figure—is therefore unusual.[^9]\n\nIn the absence of reliable information on the object’s findspot, it is\ndifficult to identify the figure with any precision. Stylistically, it\nis reminiscent of a number of examples from Centuripe datable to between\nthe end of the third century and the beginning of the second century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^10]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the hairstyle, see the small heads from the late third century\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> from Morgantina, in\n    <span class=\"smcaps\">Bell</span> 1981, nos. 608,\n    611, pl. 104.\n\n[^2]: On the role of music in funerary contexts, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Beschi</span> 1991 and the\n    bibliography already cited for Orpheus group (cat. 1–3) and [cat. 13](13),\n    n. 4.\n\n[^3]: See the statuette of a female dancer at [cat. 36](36).

See J. Lancha, s.v.\n    “Mousa/Mousae,” *LIMC* 7, suppl. (1994), p. 1021, no. 63.\n\n[^10]: The type seems also to include elements of both caricature and\n    realism that might have reflected tastes of Alexandrian inspiration\n    attested in Sicily and Magna Graecia. The grotesque deformations\n    seem to be reminiscent as well of the steatopygic female figures of\n    Alexandrian inspiration: see R. Paribeni, “Ariccia: Rilievo con\n    scene egizie,” *NSc* (1919), pp. 106–12; E. van’t Dack, “Les\n    relations entre l’Egypte ptolemaïque et l’Italie,” in E. van’t Dack,\n    P. van Dessel, and W. van Gucht, eds., *Egypt and the Hellenistic\n    World: Proceedings of the International Colloquium, Leuven, 24–26\n    May 1982* (Leuven, 1983), pp. 383–406.\n"

      "description": "\nThis half-draped figure has the left leg bent to rest the left foot on a\nrock; the torso is leaning to the left and the head is turned toward the\nright. A himation is rolled up on the hips and knotted in front,\ncovering the legs but leaving the groin and the upper body uncovered.\nThe face is oval, the hair is in wavy locks divided into two bands that\nare gathered on the nape of the neck in a low chignon; the feet are shod\nin sandals.\n\nThis figure adopts the Hellenistic type of the nymph with a bare torso\nand foot resting on a rocky elevation. This type, quite widespread in\nHellenistic statuary, is an amalgamation of various depictions of\nAphrodite: the cloak that softly drapes the lower half of the body\nrefers to Aphrodite Anadyomene; the elongated torso is derived from the\nAphrodite of Arles; and the general tone of the modeling in the\nhairstyle and the lean, oval face with its nuanced surfaces is\nPraxitelean.[^1] In its numerous variants this type can be found in\nvarious centers throughout the Mediterranean,[^2] and it gained\nconsiderable popularity in Magna Graecia and especially in Taranto,\nwhere it was reused in the local workshops.[^3] It is found in Sicily as\nwell, especially in Centuripe, where it developed in many variants with\nchanges in the attributes or the positions of the arms and head,\nattesting—especially in the Hellenistic period—to the circulation and\naffinity of Apulian iconographic types among various centers in Sicily,\nthough it is essential to evaluate the specific contexts in order to\nexplain iconography and functions of this type of statuette. Centuripe,\nin particular, was an important center for the reception and elaboration\nof outside ideas. This process has yet to be grasped in all its\ncomplexity, but in the Early Hellenistic period, the town clearly had\ndirect contact with the art of Magna Graecia, Greece, and Macedonia: a\ndense web of political relationships, beginning especially in the age of\nAgathocles, placed Sicily within the larger context of the Hellenistic\nMediterranean.[^4] The iconography of the semi-nude woman with her foot\nresting on a rock was also adopted for the portrayal of female musicians\nand Nikai, as these were related to marriage rituals and the passage in\nstatus from *kore* to *nymphe*.[^5]\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the typology of the *nymphe* with a raised foot, see A.\n    Delivorrias, s.v. “Aphrodite,” *LIMC* 1 (1981), pp. 2–151, esp. pp.\n    73–75, nos. 650–52; E.

      "description": "\n\nThe young nude Eros is standing with his weight on the left leg and the\nright leg drawn slightly back, determining the flexed pose of the torso.\nA roll of fabric is draped around the hips, dangling over his thighs,\nwith two long ends arranged on either side at the rear. The head is\nturned slightly to the left; the hair is parted over the forehead and,\nforming a bow at the top, dangles softly in puffy locks on either side\nof the neck. The face is oval, with pronounced cheekbones; the mouth is\nsmall; the facial features are nuanced. The left arm was raised, and the\nwings (now missing) must have been spread.\n\nThis youthful winged Eros with drapery rolled below his hips harks back\nto an iconography widely documented in Hellenistic coroplastic art.[^1]\nIt finds points of contact with other examples, especially those from\nTaranto and Centuripe that can be dated to the third quarter of the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> for the\nmost part belonging to funerary deposits of children.[^2] The elongated\ntorso with its soft forms echoes the more stereotypical creations of the\nPraxitelean tradition and resembles the stylistic Erotes that were\nmass-produced in Myrina, among other places. In the rendering of these\nfigures, we see the same technical methods that characterize the figures\nof the second century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>:\na generally summary modeling accompanied by a fairly rough coloring and\ninadequate firing. The expressive rendering of the figure is usually\nfocused on the movement of the arms.[^3]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Appendix\n\nThe statuette’s pigments were examined using PLM. A sample of blue from\nthe rope of drapery at the front of the figure was identified as\nEgyptian blue. The white on the drapery was identified as containing\ncalcite, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed this pigment as calcite.\nThe dark red on the hair was identified as red ocher. The pinkish-gray\npaint seen on many areas of the chest and at the pelvis was identified\nas possibly a shell white, used in ancient times but much more commonly\nin inexpensive modern paints. It had a very different appearance under\nPLM than the original white pigment. UV-visible fluorescence examination\nshows the overpainted areas clearly. Samples were taken from both the\nlower half of the figure and from the head. It is assumed that the piece\nis whole with some damage having occurred in the past. The legs were\nmost probably broken off and reattached, as was the rope of the drapery.\nThe chest suffered some damage and was repaired and painted over with\nmodern pigments. An arm had probably been reattached to the proper left\nside of the figure at some point, as adhesive residue is found there.\nThat arm is now missing, as is the right arm.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the typology of the youthful Eros, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Hermary and Cassimatis</span> 1986,\n    pp. 939–42.\n\n[^2]: See, for comparison, from Centuripe: <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Libertini</span> 1926, pl.

      "description": "\nThe mask depicts a young satyr wearing a wreath, with strongly\nemphasized facial features and a stern, somewhat threatening expression.\nThe face is round, with a powerful jaw, full cheeks, a short, rounded\nchin with a dimple in the center, and a wide-open mouth with fleshy,\nprominent lips; the upper dental arch is visible. The robust nose has\nenlarged nostrils and an upturned tip with two incisions, one at the\nbase and one in the upper part of the septum. The eyes are staring and\nhollowed out with convex eyeballs and perforated irises, surrounded by\nheavy, distinctly marked eyelids; the eyebrows are thick and furrowed;\nthe forehead has a bump in the upper portion and is furrowed by a\nhorizontal crease; the ears are feral and pointed. The hairstyle, which\nis rendered in the back with fine incisions, rises up over the forehead,\nwhere a voluminous wreath, decorated with six ivy leaves and two round\npieces of fruit at the center, was applied. There are two suspension\nholes in the lower part of the nape of the neck.\n\nThe mask is configured as a full-fledged scale model of originals that\nwere worn onstage by actors.[^1] The wreath was worked by hand and\napplied before firing. The polychromy, in keeping with tradition, was\nused to express or emphasize the distinctive character details, such as\nthe red of the male complexion, the white of the eyeballs, or the black\nof the eyebrows.\n\nThe mask seems to echo the general characteristics of the beardless\nsatyr type from New Comedy (*satyros ageneios*, or beardless satyr)\ndescribed in the *Onomastikon* by Pollux, though in this case the facial\nfeatures were interpreted with a certain creative license with respect\nto the Attic prototypes.[^2] The type, however, shows notable affinities\nwith the masks of the so-called Vollmer Group of terracottas, according\nto T. B. L. Webster’s classification, datable between the middle of the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and 50\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>; those masks are\ndistinguished by powerfully plastic modeling with marked chiaroscuro\neffects and expressive emphasis, accentuated by staring eyes and\nwide-open mouths. Examples of this group have been found in various\ncenters of the Aegean, southern Italy, and Sicily, but it is likely that\nthe type originates from Campania.\n\nThe masks related to the Vollmer Group find parallels also in the\nproduction of Myrina and Priene: for example, a mask, possibly depicting\na parasite and dating back to the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, presents similar\ncharacteristics. This means that, especially in the Late Hellenistic\nperiod, distinctive elements peculiar to one type might in some cases be\ntransmitted to and used in other typologies as well, since the serial\nproduction of masks had increasingly little to do with actual theatrical\nperformances; the iconography, therefore, tended to move toward the\ngeneric.[^3] In Sicily, examples that could be assignable to this group\nand which depict various characters from New Comedy were found in\nAgrigento, San Fratello, and Centuripe.[^4]\n\nIn other centers, as well, masks have been found that refer to\ncharacters other than the one represented by the Getty mask, but which\nare comparable on the basis of stylistic peculiarities and especially\nthe emphasis on plasticity. At Lipari, for instance, there are a number\nof small masks, datable to the first half of the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC,</span> with a convivial wreath,\nlarge staring eyes, and round eyeballs, which exhibit the distinctive\ncharacteristics of the group. A female mask found in Adrano is datable\nby stratigraphic evidence to the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and is characterized by\npowerful plastic modeling; another mask with the same characteristics at\nthe British Museum, possibly depicting a parasite and datable to the\nsecond century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, has\ntentatively been assigned to Sicily.[^5] As for the possible\narchaeological context, it should be emphasized that, according to the\ncurrent state of research in Sicily, in particular at Adrano and\nMorgantina, the most substantial group of theatrical materials comes\nfrom the settlement areas; in Lipari, by contrast, theatrical\nterracottas are documented almost exclusively in funerary contexts. Such\nis the case also at Centuripe, where, between the third and the second\ncentury <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, masks are a\nrecurring feature in funerary deposits, expressing most clearly the\nintimate relationship between the cult of the dead and Dionysian\nrituals.[^6] Moreover, masks and statuettes of actors are attested in\nthe sanctuaries of Demeter and Kore, deities linked with Dionysos in\ncult practices; thus one finds evidence of several cults within a single\nsanctuary, in keeping with a syncretistic approach attested in the\nHellenistic period.[^7] Hypothetically, the Getty mask can be assigned\nto Sicily and is most closely comparable with the production of\nCenturipe in the second century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^8]\n\n<br />\n\n### Notes\n\n[^1]: On the use of masks in theatrical practice, see U.

      "description": "\nThe *clipeus* (plaque) presents a beaded edge with a head of Medusa\n(gorgoneion), characterized by pathetic traits, applied in high relief\njust above the center. The Medusa is facing very slightly to the right,\nwith wreath wings on her head. Her undulating snaky hair, parted in the\ncenter, flows back on either side of the face; the face is full, and the\norbital area is rather marked; the mouth is small and fleshy. On her\nneck, she wears a tubular necklace with a pendant at the center; beneath\nit is a pair of intertwined snakes, also encircling her neck. Three\nconcentric rows of scales of increasing size, with a central rib,\nradiate out from the head. There are two suspension holes on the head.\n\nThis Medusa-head *clipeus* can be assigned to a well-known production\nfrom Centuripe, widespread, in the Hellenistic period, in Magna Graecia\nand in a number of centers in southeastern Sicily, such as Morgantina.\nIn Centuripe and Morgantina, *clipei* with gorgoneia were found\nprimarily in contexts dating from the third to the first centuries <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^1]\n\nIn Centuripe, especially, the iconographic motif adheres to constant\nschemes and can also be found in the vases of the time, often decorated\nwith small Gorgon heads applied in relief and characterized also by a\nsimilar use and distribution of polychromy. The iconographic scheme was\nthen varied by differences in the treatment of such elements as the\nhairstyle, the wings, or the snakes.[^2] Despite the fact that the role\nof the Gorgon in the Hellenistic period was largely decorative, its\napotropaic significance must have persisted, given that, especially in\nCenturipe, it remained one of the most popular iconographic motifs for\nthe decoration of vases and objects intended for funerary deposits.\nThese terracotta *clipei*, which served as *oscilla* (small offerings\nmeant to swing in the wind), seem to have been derived from metal\nprototypes; in Centuripe, there are reports of gilt-silver *clipei*\nshowing a bust of a maenad in three-quarter view.[^3]\n\n[^1]: See the examples from Centuripe in <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Libertini</span> 1926, pp. 117–18,\n    pl.

      "description": "\nThe male head is characterized by a voluminous beard and a thick\nhairstyle that covers the entire cranium. Both beard and hair consist of\nhand-worked thick, spiraling curls that were applied before firing. The\nface is squared off; the forehead is low and wreathed by a\nregularly-shaped border of hair; the cheekbones are high, and the\neyebrows straight. The almond-shaped eyes are defined by deep incisions\nmade while the clay was still damp; the iris is rendered through a\nshallower incised line, and the eyelids are indicated by a light\nswelling. The nose is straight and narrow, the lips are fleshy, barely\nopen, and not joined at the corners; the upper lip is more thoroughly\nmodeled and the lower lip is almost straight. The transition from the\nsmooth cheeks to the curls of the beard is rendered with finely incised\nlines, and the undulating shape of the moustache is formed by an\noverlaid layer of clay with oblique lines cut into it.\n\nThe facial features are inscribed in the face with a rigid linearity\nand, in its original appearance, the vibrant intensity and the abstract\nquality of the applied pigments would have been meant to express the\ndramatic epiphany of the god. As the discontinuous break on a line with\nthe neck indicates, the head belonged to a larger figure, probably a\nstatue.\n\nThis very peculiar head comes from Morgantina, a settlement in central\nSicily. Its archaeological context was confirmed by the discovery of\nterracotta statue fragments in the area of the *Thesmophorion* sanctuary\nat San Francesco Bisconti in Morgantina, site of the women’s cult of\nDemeter. Among the fragments of drapery and limbs, probably detached\nfrom large-scale sculptures, a number of hand-shaped spiral curls were\nfound that are identical to those on this head in terms of dimensions,\nstyle, color, and fabric.[^1]\n\nThe extramural sanctuary of San Francesco Bisconti, the most important\nin Morgantina dedicated to the goddesses Demeter and Persephone, was\ncontinuously occupied over a long period of time between the sixth and\nthird centuries <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>. It\ncomprises a complex of cultic *sacella* and *naiskoi* built on\nartificial terraces cut into the hillside.[^2] This sanctuary is the\npresumed context for a life-size statue of Demeter in marble and\nlimestone, which is exhibited in the Museo Archeologico di Morgantina in\nAidone, as well as two sets of marble acroliths—heads, hands, and\nfeet—belonging to seated cult statues of Demeter and Persephone.[^3] In\ninterpreting the head’s iconography, it is important to consider that it\nhad appeared on the antiquities market together with a terracotta female\nhead wearing a *polos*. The female head is of similar dimensions and\ndisplays an identical technical and stylistic rendering of the facial\nfeatures: voluminous masses of hair, incised eyes, straight nose, and a\nmouth defined by an undulating upper lip and downturned outer corners.\nThese characteristics make its association with this bearded head almost\ncertain. Considered together, the presumed findspot in the\n*Thesmophorion* sanctuary and the possible connection with the image of\na female deity would allow us to identify the pair as Hades and\nPersephone, central figures of ancient Sicilian worship.[^4]\n\nBoth the articulation of the sanctuary architecture and the types and\npeculiar placement of votive offerings in various areas clearly allude\nto the cult of Persephone and her mother Demeter, which was closely tied\nto agricultural fertility, female fecundity, and women’s roles as brides\nand mothers. In this context, the abduction and rape of Kore-Persephone,\nher marriage to Hades, and her cyclical return to earth (the *kathados*\nand *anados*) on which the flourishing of nature depends, were\nunderstood by the worshipers as the model of mortal marriage, closely\nintertwined with life and death, and with female and natural bounty.[^5]\nIn particular, Kore’s abduction was marked as a metaphor for the crucial\nand violent passage between maidenhood and a woman’s new status as a\nbride, a moment particularly celebrated within the ancient civic\ncommunity.[^6]\n\nThe god of the Underworld, like male figures generally, is infrequently\nrepresented in the coroplastic production of Sicily, but occurs somewhat\nmore regularly in Morgantina. From sanctuary deposits at the site, Hades\nhas been identified in a small group of large-dimension statuettes ,\nrepresenting a young, beardless male standing figure wrapped in a\nhimation that covers the legs, datable to the third century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>. In some examples, his arm is\nbent forward in a sacrificial gesture; he wears the characteristic\nwreath of the bridegroom; in one case, he holds a turquoise snake, a\ntypically chthonic attribute. According to Bell, the young man\nidentified as Hades is represented as beardless in his role of\nbridegroom, on the occasion of his wedding with Persephone.[^7]\n\nHades and Persephone are also the main characters in scenes depicted on\nthe *pinakes* dedicated as *anathemata* in the Persephoneion at\nMannella, near Locri, mainly datable to 490–450 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span>. They depict the various\nepisodes of the myth and the rituals celebrated in honor of the goddess\nin connection with the passage from childhood to adulthood, and in\nparticular from the status of *kore* to that of *nymphe*. In the\n*pinakes*, the god plays the dual role of Kore’s abductor and\nPersephone’s bridegroom in the Underworld. In the first subject, one of\nthe most frequently represented among the different iconographic\nvariants, Hades is identified with certainty only as an adult with full\nbeard and curly or wavy hair. The beardless young abductor depicted in\nsome *pinakes*, by contrast, has been extensively discussed and is\ninterpreted by some as a mere mortal: in this case, the scene could be a\nsymbolic representation of a ritual celebration of nuptials inspired by\nthe mythological event.[^8]\n\nIn the *pinakes* belonging to the group of the “consenting rape,” Hades\nand Persephone are represented as a divine pair sitting calmly in a\nquadriga, Persephone having already achieved her status as a bride;\nthere is no allusion to the violence of the act.[^9] The divine pair is\nalso extensively depicted in the *pinakes* of the *anakalypteria*\n(unveiling) group, which shows Hades and Persephone, enthroned as Queen\nof the Underworld, in a royal, solemn attitude, like two simulacra,\nreceiving offerings from other deities. In such images, Hades is shown\nwrapped in a himation that covers the lower part of his body; he may\nhold any of a variety of attributes (a pomegranate, a scepter, a phiale,\nwheat ears, or a goose). He wears a long beard and moustache, and his\nhair is either tied with a ribbon, wreathed with leaves or flowers, or\nadorned with a diadem. In some examples (type 8/10), the presence of a\ndoor may recall, as a visual synecdoche, the *thalamos* (bridal\nchamber), the realm, or a cultic place.[^10]\n\nHades’ iconography is generally quite problematic and can entail\ninterpretive ambiguities. Certain distinctive elements, nevertheless,\nrather than physiognomic features per se, can support his\nidentification: an enthroned position next to a *paredra* (consort); the\nhalf-face representation; visual allusions to the realm of the\nUnderworld; or the presence of a scepter and, in some cases, a\ncornucopia, a snake, or Cerberus.[^11] There is another remarkable group\nof *pinakes*, also from the area of the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in\nFrancavilla di Sicilia, a center that in the fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> was under\nthe political influence of Syracuse. In this group—derived from Locrian\nprototypes, as is evident from various stylistic and iconographic\naspects—the abduction scene recurs with the representation of Hades and\nPersephone as a divine couple on a quadriga in the schema of the\nconsenting rape, or enthroned in their roles as sovereigns of the\nUnderworld (*theogamiai* group), alone or with other deities. In the\n*epiphaniai* group, the two heads are depicted in silhouette, detached\nfrom any mythological description in order to underscore the essentially\nabstract and solemn values of the image.^.^[^12] In the Francavilla\n*pinakes*, Hades displays the usual features but also more peculiar\ndetails alluding to those *epikleses* (invocations) that better help to\nconnote the god: for example, the wreath or garland, probably of roses,\nalludes to Zeus Katachthonios (“Underworld Zeus”), who is also\nassimilated with Hades in his role as sovereign of the Underworld; or to\nZeus Meilichios (“kindly” or “honeyed” Zeus), a beneficent figure who\nwas associated with rites of expiation and purification. In some\n*pinakes*, Hades is also compared to Zeus Eleutherios (“Deliverer”) by\nholding an eagle-headed scepter and wearing a garland of oak leaves. The\ncult of Zeus Eleutherios flourished particularly in Syracuse after the\nfall of Thrasybulus in 466 <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and the subsequent institution of\ndemocratic government.[^13]\n\nIn Attic vases and especially in Apulian red-figure vases of the fourth\ncentury <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, the Underworld couple is extensively depicted seated or\nstanding inside a *naiskos* surrounded by various mythological figures,\nin lively scenes characterized by the decorative exuberance peculiar to\nSouth Italian pottery. In a volute krater from Canosa datable to 320 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,\nfor example, Hades demonstrates his majesty through an eagle-headed\nscepter and sumptuous garments while Persephone wearing a diadem and\nveil stands before her bridegroom holding a four-headed torch; a volute\nkrater by the White Saccos Painter is characterized by a reprisal of the\nschema of the two enthroned deities that is seen in the *pinakes*.[^14]\nThis iconographic model of the couple, repeatedly illustrated on the\n*pinakes* of Locri and Francavilla, shows them in their chthonic aspect\nbut also in a positive role as givers of fertility, possibly enthroned\nin a solemn, epiphanic vision. After more than a century, this model was\nreproduced again in the Getty’s head of Hades connected to the near twin\nhead of Persephone, both of which were probably installed within a\n*sacellum* in the *Thesmophorion* of Morgantina.[^15] Another\niconographic typology, which was already codified in the fifth century\nBC in specific contexts, centered on the figure of Persephone; it\nrecurred especially in the area of Syracuse, to which both Francavilla\nand Locri were connected politically and culturally.[^16]\n\nThis interpretation is necessarily hypothetical, given the paucity of\nmale cult sculptures recovered from sanctuaries dedicated to Demeter and\nPersephone and the absence of a precise archaeological context.[^17]\nNevertheless, analysis of the physiognomic and formal elements allow the\nplacement of this head in a context influenced by a number of works of\npost-Phidian derivation, characterized in some cases by the coloristic\neffects of the red hair and blue beard. In the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, this\nvirile type, defined by the dense mass of hair and voluminous beard, was\nadopted for a diverse array of deities, such as Dionysos, Hades, and\nZeus, evidencing the iconographic contamination that was quite common in\nthe Hellenistic period. In this instance, however, further identifying\nelements are lacking.\n\nIn the rare representations of Hades, the Underworld god often shares\ntraits with Zeus, especially when Zeus takes on chthonic connotations\nlinked with the sphere of natural fertility, as with Zeus Meilichios or\nZeus Katachthonios. These traits, as noted above, are assimilated to\nHades in the *pinakes* of Locri and Francavilla.[^18] In sculpture, a\nstatue of Zeus Katachthonios datable between 440 and 430 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> is known to have been made by\nAgorakritos, and it has been recognized in the so-called Dresden Zeus,\nwhich is characterized by distinctively intense chiaroscuro tones,\nespecially notable in the hair and beard.[^19]\n\nA number of physiognomic details—the ringlets of the beard, the\ntreatment of the hair under the lower lip, the accentuated cheekbones,\nand the mustache—place the Getty’s head within an iconographic tradition\nthat runs from the archetype of the Phidian colossus in the Temple of\nZeus at Olympia; continuing through the head of Zeus from Cyrene, also\ntraceable to the typology of the Dresden Zeus; and finally recognizable\nin the middle-Italic and Etruscan contexts in a number of terracotta\nbearded heads, such as the one in the architectural decoration of the\ntemple at Lo Scasato at Falerii, in Faliscan territory, dated to the\nfourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> It\nsignals the persistence of the Phidian artistic model, which enduringly\ninfluenced generations of artists.[^20]\n\nIn the fourth century as well, in two coinage series of Syracuse—datable\nto after 348 <span class=\"smcaps\">BC</span>, during\nthe Timoleontic period, and imitated in the issues of other Sicilian\ntowns—the profile head of Zeus Eleutherios can be seen, with a long\nbeard and curly hair held back by small olive branches. In particular,\none of the series was thought to have been derived from the staters of\nElis-Olympia, minted for the first time after 421 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC</span> and influenced by the work of\nPhidias, which continued to evolve typologically until the middle of the\nfourth century <span class=\"smcaps\">BC.</span>[^21]\nMorgantina, during its war against the Romans between 213 and 211 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,\nalso produced a silver litra characterized by the head of Zeus\nEleutherios; on the reverse is the legend <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">Sikeliotan</span>, interpretable as an\nexpression of the town’s freedom and independence in this critical\nperiod.[^22]\n\nIt is difficult to connect the Getty’s head closely with the Syracusan\ncoins of the second half of the fourth century because the images on the\ncoins rarely find exact iconographic correspondences in other media;\nnevertheless, stylistically the head can be considered as a local\n“baroque” or stereotyped interpretation of a noble typology elaborated\nwithin the classical Phidian tradition, which characterizes the artistic\nproduction of Sicily in this period. In this sense, the reprisal of\nclassical motifs during the age of Timoleon in a production associated\nwith the religious sphere was intended to express, in a conservative and\nrecognizable language, the bond to an artistic model that still felt\nalive and distinguished, in order to represent religious and political\nideals.\n\nGiven the lack of comparable male terracotta sculptures from\narchaeological contexts, it is difficult to bracket the chronology of\nthe piece. Some features, such as the mouth shape and the general facial\nstructure, seem to be related stylistically to the late fifth century\nBC, but the possibility that these elements represented a stylistic\nheritage from the second half of the fourth century, drawn from an\nearlier prototype, a period when Syracusan models dominated the artistic\nproduction of Morgantina, cannot be ruled out.[^23]\n\nThe most distinctive feature in the definition of the face—the incised\nline in the rendering of the eyes—is found in Magna Graecia and Sicily\nin a number of fictile heads that date from the sixth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> Examples include a head,\nprobably of a sphinx, from Agrigento (550–530 <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC)</span>; a head from Caulonia (late\nsixth century) now in the Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria; a large\nhead of a female deity from Medma (late sixth to early fifth century\n<span class=\"smcaps\">BC)</span>; and a number of\nprotomes from Locri, where the delineation of the eyes through deep\nincision appears to have been fairly common.[^24] The same detail, which\nmay point to bronze prototypes, is also found in the Etruscan milieu. A\nfemale head from the Campetti votive deposit at Veii, not far removed\nfrom this piece in the treatment of the lips, eyebrows, and nose, finds\nparallels in typologies dating from the Classical period, and is\nprobably assignable to the middle of the fifth century <span\nclass=\"smcaps\">BC.</span> The possibility that the\neyes and the incisions in this piece were refined with color in order to\ngive the face greater expressive intensity cannot be excluded.[^25] On\nthe other hand, it seems improbable that lashes in bronze or any other\nmaterial were inserted into the incision. This practice was more common\non marble statues (such as the female head from the sanctuary of Hera\nLacinia in Crotone and a marble head from Metaponto), though metal\nornaments such as earrings did often decorate terracotta heads and\nvotive busts.[^26]\n\nThe polychromy, in particular the blue beard, clearly had symbolic\nmeaning; blue was emblematic of eternity, due to its resemblance to the\ncolor of the sky, as well as being indicative of power and worth.[^27]\nFrom the Homeric age and according to a convention deriving from Egypt\nand Middle Eastern traditions, the color blue particularly connoted the\ngods and was used in literature for its evocative and poetic meanings,\nespecially in relation to Poseidon, Dionysos, and Hades. In fact, blue\nis only used for the representation of mortals when the character is\nalready dead or transfiguring through the intervention of a god.[^28] In\nsculpture, the most famous example is the “blue-bearded” monster from\nthe pedimental group of the Old Athena Temple in Athens, datable to\n575–550 BC; here, too, the bright color could be a figurative\ntranslation of a literary and poetic convention.[^29]\n\n<br />\n\n#### Appendix\n\nThis head was subjected to the following analyses: energy dispersive XRF\nof pigments and ground; microscopic and microchemical analysis of the\nblue pigment; infrared analysis of the rose color; determination of the\nterracotta’s firing temperature by means of thermomechanical and\nthermoluminescence analysis. The results confirmed the authenticity of\nthe piece and the dating proposed here.\n\nResults: Pigment is Egyptian blue. The reddish-brown color contains an\niron oxide pigment (ocher); a high lead content also suggests the\npresence of lead white. The firing temperature of the terracotta was\napproximately 785°C. The pigments found on the head are consistent with\nthose used at the proposed date of origin.\n\n<br />\n\n#### Notes\n\n[^1]: For the fragments of a statue from the sanctuary of San Francesco\n    Bisconti, see <span\n    class=\"smcaps\">Raffiotta</span> 2007, pp. 98–110,\n    124–25; for the curls, idem., p. 102, nos. 138–40, pl. 27.

In Greece, in the sanctuary of Demeter and\n    Kore at Corinth, the majority of large-scale terracotta sculptures,\n    Bookidis believes, represent young male votaries “more likely than\n    cult figures,” but the author also remarks that this preponderance\n    is puzzling if we consider that the majority of the figurines are\n    female and “the absence of parallels for this type of material among\n    the excavated sites and the existing sources” should be a warning:\n    N.
