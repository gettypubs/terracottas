The head is tilted slightly to the right. The face is oval, with a
rounded chin and full cheeks. The eyes are small, asymmetrical, and
close-set, with prominently marked eyelids and lowered eyebrows. The
nose is straight and the mouth is small, with soft lips whose outlines
are vaguely defined. A dimple separates the lower lip from the chin. The
hair, parted in the center, frames the forehead and temples and is
combed into large wavy locks defined by fine striations. From the part,
two fine, short, symmetrically opposed locks dangle over the forehead.

The rendering of the finely drawn and almost adolescent features, along
with the melancholy of the face, link this head to a type that is well
documented in Taranto in the fourth century <span
class="smcaps">BC</span>, although the detail of the
two fine locks of hair on the forehead are not particularly common.[^1]
The head is characterized by a number of asymmetries, such as the eyes
of different sizes and the slightly flattened left cheek. It recalls two
busts of banqueters from the first half of the fourth century <span
class="smcaps">BC</span>, both because of their rapt
expressions and because of the wavy, gathered locks of hair, which can
be found on other female heads belonging to the larger typology of
reclining figures.[^2] It also recalls a later marble female head from
Egnazia with a general Praxitelean intonation, but linked to Alexandrian
production of the first half of the second century <span
class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3]

[^1]: For the two fine locks of hair that fall in the center of the
    forehead, compare the terracotta bust of a female deity from
    Ariccia, <span class="smcaps">Carafa</span> 1996,
    fig. 2; see also the votive heads from Capua and Lucera, <span
    class="smcaps">D’Ercole</span> 1990, pl. 14; and a
    head from Palestrina from the last quarter of the fourth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC</span> in <span
    class="smcaps">Pensabene</span> 2001, pl. 43, no.
    198.

    class="smcaps">Herdejürger</span> 1982, pp. 59–61,
    nos. 115, 116, dating to 380–360 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, with other bibliographic
    references; also a small head from the votive deposit of Corti
    Vecchie in Taranto, in <span
    class="smcaps">Bartoccini</span> 1936, p. 160,
    fig. 62*.* Also compare with the female figure in C. Belli, *Il
    tesoro di Taras* (Rome and Milan, 1970), p. 195, and the Tarentine
    molds in <span class="smcaps">Deonna</span> 1930,
    pp. 67–74, fig. 5. The face with the rapt expression is also
    reminiscent of the small female head in the Musei Civici di Trieste,
    inv. 3999.
