The bull is depicted heading to the left with its head tilted in
three-quarter view. The left front hoof is raised, and the back right
hoof extends forward; the tail curves around full circle. There is a
hole pierced through at the bull’s neck. A comparable example was found
in Tomb 1 in Contrada Tesoro in Taranto.[^1]
