The figure is similar in its general characteristics to cat. 40, though
the leg is not drawn as far back; in both the slight hollow and
undulation in the fold of the drapery over the right breast is evident.
There are two marks incised into the himation: two parallel lines on the
proper left, and a mark like a *lambda* on the proper right. There is a
circular hole on the lower edge of the chiton in the figure’s back.
