The two fragments, identifiable as a Tarentine appliqué, still show
extensive traces of the original gilding. The first fragment preserves
only the body of a griffin with truncated back legs; the second fragment
depicts a griffin in a symmetrical position, in the act of clutching
with its left front claw a fallen animal, perhaps a stag, only the back
part of whose body is still preserved. The griffin holds its prey still
with its right back claw as it sinks its fangs into the animal’s back.
The attachment of the griffin’s right front claw to the animal’s body
forms an eyehole that was probably used to attach the relief to the
sarcophagus.[^1]
