The position and weight of the figure are similar to those of the other
members of this group (cat. 38–41). The coroplast worked on the
individual pieces, varying the position of the heads and retouching the
facial features and the drapery. The head is tilted to the right and the
knee of the bent leg is turned a little more to the left; the eyebrows
are arched to a greater degree, forming two furrows in the middle of the
forehead; the upper lip is fleshier, and the expression of grief is more
marked. Incised on the lower hem of the himation on the proper left side
is the letter *alpha*.
