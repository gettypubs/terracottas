The figure is similar in its general characteristics to the preceding
two pieces; here, however, the weight of the body is resting on the left
leg, while the right leg is pulled back and bent, and the head is turned
toward the left. The facial features are similar to those of cat. 38. On
the lower right of the himation, a mark (comparable to the letter
*lambda*) is engraved.
