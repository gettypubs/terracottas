Galerie Hydra (Geneva, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum,

The standing female figure in a frontal position has a bent left leg,
pushed slightly forward; her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands
are raised in a gesture of lamentation; the fingers are spread wide and
are clearly shaped, with an indication of fingernails. The head is
tilted slightly to one side and turned toward the left; the face is oval
and lean, the chin is sharp, the forehead is high, the eyebrows are
furrowed, the nose is accentuated; the pupils and the irises are etched,
and the eyelids are clearly marked; the mouth, with its lower lip
projecting more than the upper, is stretched in an expression of
sadness.

The figure wears a chiton adorned by a vertical pink band on the proper
left side and a himation with a pointed border worn as a shawl that
drapes over the bust, revealing the chiton beneath on either side; the
chiton is defined by a circular hem in the front and by broad pleats
rendered sketchily in three dimensions. This type of costume is also
found on figures painted on Apulian vases.[^1] An “H” sign is incised
into the himation.
