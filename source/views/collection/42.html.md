title: Statue of a Mourning Woman
cat: 42
fabric: >
  light brown, slightly reddish, in color (Munsell 2.5 yr 8/4 7/6). No slip or ground layer is preserved on this figure. Polychromy: red pigment on the hair.
condition: > 
  Assembled from numerous fragments. The arms and the left foot are missing, and with the exception of areas on the hair, the abraded terracotta surface has been completely stripped of all polychromy and burial accretions. Vertical striations are visible over most of the figure where the artisan scraped a tool over the surface to smooth it. The interior shows signs of being pressed and worked with hands. There are striations running horizontally across the inside and fingerprints are present in several areas. There are two firing cracks, both in the back of the figure.[^1]

This statue, like those in the previous entries (cat. 38–41), has been
assigned by Violaine Jeammet to the group of mourners or orantes wearing
a long himation with a conical structure, tending to broaden at the
shoulders.[^2] The face is modeled with greater freedom of expression;
the hair, again rendered through stylized incisions, is arrayed on the
forehead in softer waves and is gathered at the back. The head is tilted
to the left, the furrowing of the brow is expressed by four wrinkles
carved in the center and on the sides of the eyebrows, which are
profoundly arched and accentuate the cavity of the eyes. There are three
circular holes (approximately 1.5 cm in diameter) on the lower part of
the chiton in the front and back of the figure, and vertical striations
are visible on the surface, left by the coroplast’s tools.

In its general composition, it shows close similarities to an orant in
the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, already linked to the
Barbarossa hypogeum.[^3]

Appendix

The piece has been subjected to a thermoluminescence examination, which
