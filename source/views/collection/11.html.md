The female head has regular features and is turned slightly to the
right. The oval yet full face has a rounded chin, understated
cheekbones, lowered superciliary arches, and small, asymmetrical,
almond-shaped eyes with clearly defined eyelids. The nose is small and
the fleshy neck is marked at its proper right side by a wrinkle made by
the slightly tipped head. The low forehead is framed by hair gathered in
two wavy bands and combed softly toward the occiput, with two ringlets
falling alongside the neck, leaving the ears uncovered. The figure wears
disk-shaped earrings. At the back of the head, the hair, parted in the
middle, is combed into horizontal and parallel waves rendered by quickly
executed incisions. On the nape of the neck, there is a circular hole.

The softness of the shaping and rendering, the slight turn of the head,
the barely parted lips, the way the eyes are sunk into the orbital
cavities, and the prominence of the superciliary arches, which emphasize
the intensity of the gaze and accentuate the pictorial surface values,
all place this head in the context of Tarentine sculpture of Praxitelean
inspiration.[^1] In particular, one terracotta female head, now in
Kassel. dated from the beginning of the fourth century <span
class="smcaps">BC</span>, presents similar
characteristics, such as the hairstyle with two curls dropping down
alongside the neck and the regular, nuanced facial features with sunken
eyes with a rim of shadow just beneath the eyebrows.[^2] The rounded
strands of hair form loose waves from a central part down to the
temples, with curls falling along either side of the neck. They also
recur in a mold in the Getty Museum (inv. 74.AD.54 reproducing a female
head signed “LY,” referring perhaps to a Tarentine coroplast active in
the middle and third quarter of the fourth century <span
class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3] This may also be
compared with another head from Taranto in Basel, which has a similar
hairstyle but is in a frontal position and is characterized by a harsher
expression. For the treatment of the hairstyle and the coloristic
rendering of the locks, a comparison can also be made with a bust of a
seated female figure in Basel datable to the second quarter of the
fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> period
in which the Getty head might be dated<span
class="smcaps">.</span>[^4]

    pendant, see T. Schojer, “Orecchini,” in <span

    resemblance is also notable in the hairstyle of the head in the
