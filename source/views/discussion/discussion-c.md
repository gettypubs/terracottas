#### Four Statues of Mourning Women from Canosa (cat. 38–41)

<h6 class="discussion-note">This discussion is reproduced on each of the individual object pages</h6>

This group of mourning women, often understood as orantes (female
figures in prayer), likely comes from a chamber tomb in the Canosa area,
as is attested by comparable examples in various collections. A
technical examination of some statues from Canosa conducted by the
Louvre conservation laboratories has made it possible to identify
certain details of the fabrication. The figures were made not with
molds, as was initially conjectured (considering, among other things,
the lack of joint lines and the overall resemblance among the various
pieces), but rather through a modeling process over a hollow, conical,
and fairly thick structure. Working from the bottom up, clay pieces were
laid over this structure to define the anatomy and iconographic details
of the figure. The forearms, created separately, and the head, made with
a bivalve mold, were inserted in holes specially made by the craftsman.
The tubular structure was then modeled from within to establish the
round shapes of knees and breasts, and from the exterior, through the
application of clay parts, to depict in three dimensions the details of
the chiton and himation, such as the circular folds and the hem of the
himation on the figures’ torsos and the lateral folds of the chiton. On
the inside bent knee of one figure (cat. 38), there are vertical strokes
in the clay, made by fingers pulling downward. The structure is in any
case well smoothed and finished on the interior: there is a slight ridge
at the waist in two of the statues. The coroplast attempted to smooth
the surface, probably using a throwing stick, from the opening in the
base, as can be seen by the circular traces left on the interior
surface. A spatula and other sharp tools were used to define the hair,
eyes, and various details of clothing.

The facial features, in a clearly local style, are made with a type of
mold also utilized for other pieces from Canosa.[^1] As in other
statues, there are circular holes in the lower extremities into which
wooden pins would have been inserted to fasten the statue onto a
base.[^2] The symbols, carved directly into the fresh clay, can be
interpreted as alphabetical markers to aid in the practical requirements
of the factory process; given the nature of these signs, which suggest
haste, it is impossible to interpret them with any certainty.[^3]

The colors were applied after the firing over a preparatory layer of
white slip, which has been preserved in several areas. The slip is
heavily applied in large “swipes” as though done with a tool. It is
possible to see some striations in the swipes but not fingerprints.[^4]
The palette shows little variety, consisting of pink, red, white,
possibly dark brown, and black, although the latter two pigments cannot
be confirmed. This limited palette is found in other examples and
corresponds to a chromatic taste also attested in the Canosan vases.

The most pertinent comparison for these statues can be found in the type
called “orantes with the long himation.” This group, according to a
recently proposed classification, shows affinities in the treatment of
the clothing and in the weighting and position of the arms. The
comparison is especially good with the group of such orantes, which have
heads showing harsh and marked facial features and hair pulled back into
a point on the back.[^5] Relative to these other pieces, the Getty
statues are characterized by a general lack of plasticity and by sketchy
modeling, underscored by a certain compositional naïveté, an excessively
rigid pose, and a general lack of compactness in the structure.[^6] The
same stylistic tendency can be found in other coroplastic products such
as full-relief statuettes in the round, depicting female figures, Nikai,
and Erotes, that decorate *askoi*; these are characterized by a
superabundance of decoration. The similarity attests to the close
collaboration that existed among potters, painters, and coroplasts in
creating a substantially unified expressive language.[^7] Among the
numerous examples are the orantes that decorate an *askos* in the Museo
Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto, with the same type of clothing and
raised arms, and an *askos* from the Varrese hypogeum (rock-cut funerary
complex) of Canosa, with similar statuettes, equine protomes, and a head
of Medusa datable to the third century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^8]
Likewise, the figures painted on the wall of the chamber tomb in the Sant’Aloia
area of Canosa, dating from the first half of the third century
<span class="smcaps">BC</span>, are characterized by facial features and a
general compositional structure reminiscent of the Getty statues; they also seem
to point to models from the Campanian area, such as the figure from “Tomb X” of
Paestum.[^9]

The statues, which were intended to be placed around a funerary *kline*,
constituted an especially costly funerary offering and were thus
probably intended for a fairly prestigious client who, in the context of
Romanization in the area, aspired to underscore his economic prosperity,
personal identity, and native traditions, in part through emphasis on
funerary rituals.[^10] In Canosa between the second half of the fourth
century and the first half of the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,
there was a culturally advanced aristocracy that was anxious to affirm its
status and more open to the influence of the Greek regions of Magna Graecia and
Macedonia, in part due to the political and military relations established with
Alexander I of Molossia (r. 362–330/329 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>).
Links with and influences from the Macedonian world can be identified, for
instance, in the funerary architectural models that were absorbed and adapted
to local cultural traditions.[^11] Although it is possible to note considerable
differences among the various examples of statues, both in terms of
clothing and in poses and hairstyles, the statues do seem to depict one
type of youthful female figure, probably envisioned as one of the female
mourners who, during funeral ceremonies, and especially during the
*prothesis* (laying out of the body), expressed their grief at the loss
of the deceased.[^12]

The archaeological context of the orantes from Canosa has been
extensively debated and mostly remains unresolved. The pieces have been
dispersed among various museum collections, both public and private, due
to the massive diffusion of Canosan grave goods into the antiquities
market.[^13]

Recent studies have examined four hypogea about whose discovery more is
known. Scanty though these accounts of discovery are, they seem to
attest that the statues must were placed inside the tombs in pairs or in
any case in multiples of two. In particular, eight pieces are thought to
originate from Scocchera B hypogeum in Canosa. Of these, two are
currently in the Musée de la Ville de Rouen (inv. 1965) and in the
National Museum of Copenhagen (inv. 4995); one is in the Worcester Art
Museum (inv. 2008.50); another pair, from the description provided by
Cozzi of the actual discovery of the hypogeum, may be those now in the
Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow (inv. II 1⁰ 634 and 635). The
solitary figure in the Museo Castromediano in Lecce might belong to this
same context; great uncertainty persists concerning the identification
of the eighth piece.[^14]

A number of statues must have come from the Barbarossa hypogeum, and of
these, three may now be in the collection of the Museo Archeologico
Nazionale in Naples.[^15] An orant generally attributed to the
Barbarossa hypogeum might actually have come from the Lagrasta I
hypogeum, which was excavated between 1843 and 1845.[^16] Finally, the
Tomb of the Gold Ornaments (Tomba degli Ori) was the source of three or
four statues of orantes: the pieces now in the Museo Civico Archeologico
in Canosa and the Museo Archeologico di Santa Scolastica in Bari might
have come from this context.[^17]

The problem of dating the Getty figures is bound up with the
reexamination of funerary deposits belonging to the Canosa hypogea. For
the Scocchera B tomb, dates have been suggested between the end of the
third century and the second century centuries <span class="smcaps">BC</span>;
but the statues are thought to date from the first half of the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, since the hypogeum remained
in use for about a century following its construction, as attested,
among other things, by the presence of glass vases.[^18] For the
Barbarossa hypogeum, the same chronological discrepancy exists, given
the presence—alongside red-figure vases from the end of the fourth
century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and the statues of orantes—of glass
pieces and goldwork as well that can be dated to the second century
<span class="smcaps">BC</span>; once again, these discrepancies are due to the
continued use of the hypogeum over several generations.[^19] In the Lagrasta
hypogeum, too, alongside the red-figured vases, there have been finds of glass
pieces and a Latin inscription from 67 <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^20]
For the Tomb of the Gold Ornaments, on the other hand, the end of the third century
 <span class="smcaps">BC</span> seems to be a date widely
accepted by scholars.[^21] In the absence of reliable excavation
contexts, it seems advisable to date the group of orantes to the early
third century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>

#### Notes

[^1]: For the technical working of the statue and the hypothetical use
    of bivalve molds, see <span class="smcaps">Jeammet
    and Nadalini</span> 1997; for a review of the problem, <span
    class="smcaps">Jeammet</span> 2003a. This study,
    which explores the problems linked to Canosan statues in the Louvre
    and surveys all the pieces in the various public and private museum
    collections, proposes a classification according to technical and
    iconographic criteria. According to this scheme, the Getty orantes
    have been included in the group characterized by a “long himation
    and a conical structure that tends to widen at the height of the
    shoulders.” The bivalve mold for the heads, catalogued as m5, seems
    to have been used for the pieces in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in
    Copenhagen as well.

[^12]: It has been proposed that the iconographic differentiations among
    the statues may point not only to differences in age, but also to
    different roles played by women in funerary rites: <span

[^13]: The dispersal of material from Canosa is documented, in part, by
    the numerous pieces that have appeared on the antiquities market,
    i.e., the statue of an orante in *Antiquities,* Bonhams
    Knightbridge, sale cat., November 26, 1997, lot 316 (current
    location unknown). The orant, very similar to the Getty ones, in
    *Classical, Egyptian and Western Asiatic Antiquities and Islamic
    Works of Art*, Sotheby’s New York, Sale 6717, June 1, 1995, lot 113,
    is now in the San Antonio Museum of Art (inv. 95.18.2).

[^15]: According to the hypothesis set forth by Jeammet, it was instead
    the Barbarossa hypogeum that might have been the source of four
    orantes: the two now in the Louvre, the one in London, and the one
    in the Sant’Angelo collection of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in
    Naples: <span class="smcaps">Jeammet 2003a</span>,
