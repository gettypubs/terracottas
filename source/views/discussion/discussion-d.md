#### Statuettes of a Seated Eros (cat. 45–46)

These musician Erotes must originally have been mounted on animals:
beneath the buttocks, there are no traces of slip or polychromy. The
typology is reminiscent of Daunian examples from Canosa in the third
century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, but is also
similar to the Erotes from the Hypogeum of Ganymede in Arpi. Unlike most
of the Erotes from Arpi, however, these two still preserve their musical
instruments.[^1] The effeminate appearance of little Erotes like these
is often accentuated, especially in terracotta statuettes, by such
ornaments as necklaces and leg bands.

Eros, who in the Classical period is primarily a figure complementary to
Aphrodite and Dionysos, enlarged his role in the Hellenistic period to
become an interlocutor with the female world and a protector of marriage
and female fertility, while continuing to operate in the sphere of
Dionysos and Aphrodite in a broad array of situations, with the chief
function of spreading good cheer and merriment. The type of the child
Eros playing musical instruments was, beginning at the end of the fourth
century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and in the
third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,
widespread throughout the entire Mediterranean and became a point of
reference in the iconography of goldwork and toreutics.[^2] In the
Daunian area and especially at Canosa, where there was a close
relationship between coroplastic art and vase decoration, small Erotes
were also attached to polychrome vases of the same period.[^3] There was
an especially close link between Eros and music: in Attic vase-painting,
Eros is often shown handing musical instruments to ephebes or watching a
musical performance in the context of the gynaikeion (women’s quarters),
while in the Hellenistic period Eros also accompanied the Muses, as
documented by images on gems.[^4] Similar Erotes from the region of
Daunia are now found in many major museum collections and frequently
appear on the antiquities market, often in pairs and groups of four, as
they must have originally been found in their source contexts.[^5]
