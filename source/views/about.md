In the ancient world, terracotta sculpture was ubiquitous. Readily available and economical&#8212;unlike stone suitable for carving&#8212;clay allowed artisans to craft figures of remarkable variety and expressiveness. Terracottas from South Italy and Sicily attest to the prolific coroplastic workshops that supplied sacred and decorative images for sanctuaries, settlements, and cemeteries. Sixty terracottas are investigated here by noted scholar Maria Lucia Ferruzza, comprising a selection of significant types from the Getty’s larger collection&#8212;life-size sculptures, statuettes, heads and busts, altars, and decorative appliqués. In addition to the comprehensive catalogue entries, the publication includes a guide to the full collection of over one thousand other figurines and molds from the region by Getty curator of antiquities Claire L. Lyons.

This custom online catalogue enables a deeper exploration of these ancient objects, with zoomable high-resolution photography and a select number of 360-degree rotations; the ability to [filter the catalogue](../catalogue/) by location, typology and date; and an [interactive map](../map/) drawn from the Ancient World Mapping Center and linked to the Getty’s Thesaurus of Geographic Names. The complete catalogue can be [downloaded for free in multiple formats](#downloads), as can the object data and main images. For readers who wish to have a bound reference copy, a [paperback](http://shop.getty.edu/products/ancient-terracottas-from-south-italy-and-sicily-in-the-j-paul-getty-museum-978-1606064863){:target="blank"} version is available for sale.
