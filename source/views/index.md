In the ancient world, terracotta sculpture was ubiquitous. Readily available and economical&#8212;unlike stone suitable for carving&#8212;clay allowed artisans to craft figures of remarkable variety and expressiveness. Terracottas from South Italy and Sicily attest to the prolific coroplastic workshops that supplied sacred and decorative images for sanctuaries, settlements, and cemeteries. Sixty terracottas are investigated here by noted scholar Maria Lucia Ferruzza, comprising a selection of significant types from the Getty’s larger collection&#8212;life-size sculptures, statuettes, heads and busts, altars, and decorative appliqués.
