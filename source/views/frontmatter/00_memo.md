Notes

1)  Images: we will need to get together with Elizabeth Kahn to organize
    the images when she is back. There are no figure callouts in
    the text.

2)  Each catalogue number has its own entry, except for cat. 47 and 48,
    which are a pair and have a single entry.

3)  Links: references to other catalogue entries have been highlighted.

4)  It would also be nice to link:

-   the bibliographic short forms in each entry’s notes to the main
    bibliography;

-   abbreviations in the notes and bibliography to the list of
    abbreviations;

-   there are also references to other notes within the notes;

-   references to other objects in the Getty’s collection.

1)  The catalogues are organized by the following subheads \[italics
    refer to subheads that occur only occasionally; brackets note
    subheads that are untitled in the text\]:
