The following guide to the entire collection of terracottas from
southern Italy and Sicily in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum
is intended as a supplement to *Ancient Terracottas from South Italy and
Sicily in the J. Paul Getty Museum*. In addition to the sixty objects
studied in depth by Maria Lucia Ferruzza, the museum holds a quantity of
statuettes, sculptures, and artifacts that have not been closely
analyzed; many remain largely unpublished. Spanning the centuries
between 5000 <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and the second century
<span class="smcaps">AD</span>, small numbers of Neolithic,
Mycenaean, Cypriote, Greek (Boeotian and Tanagra), East Greek (Rhodian,
Samian, and Mysian), Etruscan, Romano-Egyptian, and Roman figurines were
acquired individually. By far the largest group of terracottas, however,
consists of votive dedications from sanctuaries and cemeteries in
Apulia, Lucania, Calabria, Campania, and on Sicily. Most were donations
received in the 1970s–80s and destined to form a study collection.

With the aim of facilitating further research on this material, this
index provides links to over 1,000 terracottas. Two major lots consist
of fragmentary figures that can be associated with Taranto and
Metaponto, while a third lot and other individual pieces are more
generally identified with workshops in southern Italy. Although the lack
of documentation makes it difficult to ascertain whether some extraneous
objects were mixed in with these lots, the repetition of types and the
consistency of the fabric suggest that these assemblages were found
together in votive deposits. The focus of *Ancient Terracottas* is
extended here in two key areas. This Guide includes several female heads
from a mold series known in Capua, as well as a significant group of
statuettes likely to come from Teano, which reflect the links between
Campania and production centers in Magna Graecia and Latium. Important
for any study of the rich coroplastic traditions of the Italian
peninsula is the series of thirty-nine molds, mainly made in Taranto,
four of which are inscribed with the coroplast’s name or monogram.

The collection of portable, mass-produced terracottas, including Canosan
figural vessel appliqués (but excluding lamps, plastic vases, and
architectural sculpture), is indexed below according to the region of
origin. Inventory numbers are linked to the Museum’s online collection
pages
([www.getty.edu/art/collection/](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/)),
where readers can access additional data on specific objects. The brief
descriptions below are based on the information supplied at the time of
acquisition, from publications, and more recent observations. As
research advances, the online collection catalogue will evolve.

### Taranto

-   **71.AD.311**: Banqueting couple, late fourth–third century
    <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. <span class="smcaps">Kingsley</span> 1976, p. 6, no. 10, fig. 10; B. M. Kingsley, “The Reclining Heroes of Taras and Their Cult,” *California Studies in Classical Antiquity* 12
    (1979), p. 205, n. 75.
-   **71.AD.339**: Crouching satyr with protruding ears, looking upward
    with his right hand on his chest; early fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.
-   **75.AD.36**: Seated woman, headless, from a banquet group, with a
    vertical tang to hold the figure upright; fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span class="smcaps">Kingsley</span> 1976, p.6, no. 7, pl. 7.
-   **75.AD.37**: Male banqueter, bearded, reclining and holding a cup,  
    with a vertical tang to hold the figure upright; fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span class="smcaps">Kingsley 1976,</span> p. 5, no. 4, pl. 4.
-   **75.AD.40.1–90**: Group of 90 small heads of women wearing floral
    crowns, averaging 2 cm in height. Most are broken off at the neck
    and the facial features are worn. One figure (75.AD.40.I.14) has a
    disc/phiale at her left shoulder; two statuettes of women bearing a
    torch (75.AD.40.I.1). Fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>
-   **78.AD.271.4**: Naked youth, often identified as the hero Taras, with
    drapery flying behind, riding a dolphin across waves. The figure is
    supported on a cylindrical base, and the head of the youth and tail
    of the dolphin are missing; fourth–third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.
-   **78.AD.344**: Reclining male banqueter; early fifth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>.
-   **80.AD.74**: Head of a young woman wearing a *polos*; late fifth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.
-   **83.AD.354.1–394**: Group of 292 votives, comprising types mainly
    associated with Taranto and Metaponto (see below for further
    discussion of the 55 Metapontine examples). The earliest Tarentine
    votives in this lot date from the mid sixth–fifth centuries <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and depict figures of a standing goddess with a snake, a sphinx, a head of a woman wearing a conical *polos*, and a pair of seated goddesses. One fragment of the upper arm of a woman wearing a chiton fastened by three buttons (83.AD.354.15) is close to
    life size. A small number (21 objects) are fourth-century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> types:
    squatting silenos, head of a silenos or papposilenos, satyr playing
    flutes, heads of comic actors, and female heads and figures. The
    majority of the objects belong to the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, with a great
    variety of figures and heads of women with melon coiffeurs (standing
    and seated, draped and nude female figures; dancer, mother
    and child). Also present are figurines of animals (dogs, cat, coiled
    snake, birds, horse, ape on a lion’s back, lion, turtle, animals
    mounting, cow?, boy riding a pig); mythological figures (Aphrodite
    leaning against a pillar, standing nude figure of Aphrodite, Nike,
    Eros); and a small number of male figures (head of a boy, torso).

### Terracotta Molds

Thirty-nine molds depict types that belong to the repertoires of
Tarentine and, more generally, South Italian terracottas. Seven molds
acquired in 1973 were part of a group of 430 fourth-century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> terracottas, mainly representing female heads (see 73.AD.10 under “South Italy”). In 1974, 1975, and 1976, three groups of Tarentine molds came to the Getty from the collection of Norman Neuerberg. These molds produced figurines in the round and reliefs for decorative appliqués. Four examples are marked with the names or monograms of Tarentine coroplastic workshops.

    date from the mid-sixth to the early fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.

### Canosa

Several terracotta figures functioned as appliques on vessels and
probably come from Apulian funerary contexts in or near Canosa:

<br />

-   80.AE.37: Eros riding an animal, lacking the head, arms, wings, and
    lower legs; traces of polychrome pigment on baldric (red) and
    chlamys (pink); third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span
    class="smcaps">Van der Wielen-Van Ommeren</span>
    1985, p. 181, no. 9, fig. 11.

-   80.AE.38.a: Pigeon, hand-modeled, with white slip and polychrome
    pigments (red for feathers, blue contour line around wing, red
    collar, purple on the neck; early third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span
    class="smcaps">Van der Wielen-Van Ommeren</span>
    1985, p. 180, no. 7, fig. 10.

-   80.AE.38.b: Pigeon, hand-modeled, with traces of polychromy; early
    third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. Similar birds served as attachments on Canosan
    vases or were placed in graves as offerings. See <span
    class="smcaps">Van der Wielen-Van Ommeren</span>
    1985, p. 180, no. 8, fig. 10.

-   81.AD.126: Paw of a lion, possibly the foot of a vessel or stand,

    <span class="smcaps">Van der Wielen-Van
    Ommeren</span> 1985, p. 181–82, no. 10, fig. 12.

### South Italy

-   71.AD.345: Seated goddess, probably Persephone, wearing an epiblema
    and a chiton, with her head is tilted to the left. Traces of
    polychromy are visible on the surface; third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.

-   71.AD.346: Goddess seated on a high, round-backed throne, wearing a
    chiton, himation, and *stephane* with a central ornament; large
    loops of hair at each ear; third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.

-   71.AD.358: Upper half of a seated goddess, perhaps Persephone,
    wearing a himation and veil, with her right arm resting on her lap.
    The goddess is seated on a throne; pairs of rosettes decorate the
    backrest on either side of her shoulders; fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>.

-   73.AD.10: Group of 466 votives dated to the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> on the
    basis of associated sherds of an Attic red-figure bell krater, Attic
    lekythoi, a lamp, South Italian, and Gnathia pottery sherds. In
    addition to the seven South Italian molds listed above, the lot is
    almost exclusively composed of female heads, fragmentary figures,
    and a small number of male heads, 55 of which are identified as
    “Greek” types. Of the 15 discoid or horse-shoe loom-weights
    (73.AD.10.I.1-15), several have figural reliefs, with images of a
    kneeling child holding an animal, Eros on a dolphin, Aphrodite
    riding a swan, an owl with arms holding a distaff over a kalathos,
    frontal head of a woman, and two facing busts (the so-called
    kissers type). The loom-weights belong to a series regularly found
    at sites in the region of Taranto, Metaponto, and Herakleia,
    beginning in the second half of the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. If they
    belong with the accompanying group of votive heads, an origin in one
    of the Greek settlements along the Ionian coast is likely.

### Campania

-   71.AD.304: Head of a woman, with melon coiffeur and veil, and a long
    neck incised Venus rings; from a mold series found at Capua, ca.
    250–200 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span
    class="smcaps">Smithers</span> 1993, p. 26, fig.
    18.

-   71.AD.305: Head of a woman, with disc earrings and a veil covering
    the back portion of the head, from the same mold generation as an
    identical head in the Museo Campano in Capua, dated 300–275 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See
    <span class="smcaps">Smithers</span> 1993, p.
    24, fig. 14.

-   71.AD.306: Head of a woman, wearing a veil, a fillet with a central
    bead, and a coiled torque necklace; stylistically similar to heads
    in Capua and Cales, 300–250 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. See <span

-   82.AD.52.1–153: A large group of votives was donated in 1982 and
    reportedly comes from Campania. Many of the figures are fragmentary
    and show evidence of burning. The fabric is reddish brown with black
    and reflective inclusions, and the statuettes are hand modeled and
    summarily finished with a tool; there are occasional traces of cream
    slip and red pigment. Dating to the sixth and fifth centuries <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,
    the group comprises male and female figures standing on rectangular
    plinths; heads of women, some wearing a tall, flaring *polos*
    (82.AD.52.10); men wearing short pleated tunics fastened on one
    shoulder (82.AD.52.133); male heads, some with crested
    helmets (82.AD.52.129) or other styles of headgear; shields with a
    fragmentary hand or arm attached to the inside; a seated figure with
    an animal; a plaque of a standing figure with a snake; and men, both
    draped and nude, standing with hands on hips 82.AD.58.132, .135). On
    some, locks are hair are denoted by circular
    impressions (82.AD.52.128). A large statuette (82.AD.52.1, H. 56 cm)
    of a warrior sports a short Italic-type cuirass ending above the
    genitals and a helmet. In addition to the statuettes, the group
    includes a Campanian female antefix (82.AD.52.70) crowned with a
    headband and radiating tongues. The consistency of the fabric,
    repetition of types, and pattern of damage suggest that the
    statuettes formed part of a single votive deposit. Similar statuette
    types are attested in votive deposits from the sanctuary of Juno
    Popluna at Masseria Soppegna, Fondo Ruozzo, near Teano.
