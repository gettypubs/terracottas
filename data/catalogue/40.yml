    light orange in color (Munsell 7. 57.5 yr 8/4); slip and polychromy are like
    those of the other members of this group. Polychromy: vertical organic pink
    bands along the right and left sides of the chiton; iron-based red pigment
    in the hair, feet, and traces in the mouth; white pigment ground layer.
    There are two circular holes, one on the lower edge of the chiton and another
    on the figureâ€™s right side.
  :condition: >
    Broken and repaired, abraded terracotta surface. The figure is covered in
    thick burial accretion and modern overpaint, which extends over the white
    ground layer.
  :provenance: >
    1985, Galerie Hydra (Geneva, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum,
    1985.

    The figure is similar in its general characteristics to the preceding
    two pieces; here, however, the weight of the body is resting on the left
    leg, while the right leg is pulled back and bent, and the head is turned
    toward the left. The facial features are similar to those of [cat. 38](38). On
    the lower right of the himation, a mark (comparable to the letter
    *lambda*) is engraved.
