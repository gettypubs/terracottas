    Light orange in color (Munsell 7. 57.5 yr 8/4); slip and polychromy are like those of the other members of this group. Polychromy: vertical organic pink bands along the right and left sides of the chiton; iron-based red pigment in the hair, feet, and traces in the mouth; white pigment ground layer. There are two circular holes, one on the lower edge of the chiton and another on the figure’s right side.
  :condition: >
    Broken and repaired; abraded terracotta surface. The figure is covered in thick burial accretion and modern overpaint, which extends over the white ground layer.
  :provenance: >
    – 1985, Galerie Hydra (Geneva, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1985.

    The figure is similar in its general characteristics to [cats. 38](../38/) and [39](../39/); here, however, the weight of the body is resting on the left leg, while the right leg is pulled back and bent, and the head is turned toward the left. The facial features are similar to those of [cat. 38](../38/). On the lower right of the himation, a mark (comparable to the letter *lambda*) is engraved.
