    Light beige in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/3), with a very fine and friable
    consistency, and small blackish inclusions; a layer of white slip. The
    statuette was made from a bivalve mold; it is open in the back, and there is
    a circular hole underneath the figure, probably for attachment to a base.

  :description: |2
    This character is depicted with his legs crossed; his right arm is
    folded beneath his chest, and his left hand is propped beneath his chin
    in a pose of reflection. The original seat is missing, but in accordance
    with numerous comparisons to the type, it may be conjectured that it was
    a parallelepiped-shaped altar. The figure wears a short tunic with
    sleeves and belt and, over it, a short cloak of which a section hangs
    below the left shoulder; on his feet are sandals with T-straps. The face
    is broad, and the hair is brushed in a *speira* hairstyle, which forms
    a compact mass with radial striations around the face; the mouth is open
    wide and is surrounded by a large trumpet shape formed by the mustache
    and the short beard, which still leaves the lips and gums visible. The
    figure has a snub nose that is quite broad at the base; the eyebrows are
    prominent and asymmetrical and join at the middle of the forehead, which
    is creased by deep wrinkles. This figure is a depiction of the leading
    slave (*hegemòn therapon*), a key character of New Comedy: a protagonist
    in amorous intrigues, often described and portrayed in lively or mocking
    stances. Whereas in Old Comedy and Middle Comedy the slave appeared in
    grotesque costume, the New Comedy figure wears only the short chiton and
    cloak; these distinctive characteristics make him easily recognizable in
    the context of New Comedy masks.[^1] In particular, the snub nose, the
    *speira* hairstyle (often painted red to emphasize the character’s
    negative nature), and especially the singular “trumpet” that frames and
    deforms the mouth—previously found in Old Comedy and Middle Comedy as
    permanent attributes of the character—appear more stylized in this
    period.

    The character of the seated leading slave, who has escaped from some
    dangerous situation and takes refuge in a sanctuary, is derived from
    Athenian typological models. It is found in a number of variants and
    interpretations in numerous centers of Greece and the Mediterranean
    basin between the end of the fourth century and the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2]

    In Magna Graecia and Sicily, the extensive presence in funerary
    deposits of terracottas with theatrical subjects and powerful symbolic
    and religious values has generally been linked to the spread of the cult
    of Dionysos and can be interpreted in eschatological terms.[^3]

    In the Hellenistic period, as is known from funerary deposits—especially
    from non-adult tombs—Taras seems to have become the most active center
    in Magna Graecia for the coroplastic production of material with a
    theatrical subject, a context to which this type may be tentatively
    linked. It is prevalent in such deposits dated between the last quarter
    of the third century and the first quarter of the second century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^4] It has been proposed
    that the statuettes of theatrical subjects, including this
    statuette, could be linked not only to the Dionysian cult but also to
    burial sites of children who died at an age when they were preparing to
    participate with adults in the life of the theater; such statuettes
    could therefore be intended to emphasize the transition from childhood
    to maturity.[^5]

    At Lipari, where a prolific production of comic statuettes extends over
    a period from the first half of the fourth century to the first half of
    the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, the
    type of the seated leading slave is represented by a group of Middle
    Comedy statuettes, while the standing slave is the type that is chiefly
    documented for New Comedy. The mask of chief servant is, in any case,
    the type most frequently depicted in New Comedy terracottas of
    Lipari.[^6]

    In Morgantina, statuettes of comic actors derived from the Attic
    repertory and elaborated on a local basis have been found in both
    sanctuaries and dwellings, and they seem to date primarily between 330
    and 280 <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> According to
    Bell, they should be related to the cult of Demeter.[^7] From Centuripe
    in Sicily comes a statuette of a slave seated on an altar, with legs
    crossed, the trumpet-shaped mouth, and the short cape tossed over the
    left shoulder; another piece representing a slave seated on an altar
    comes from the votive deposit of Butera dating from the second half of
    the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^8]

    The slave taking refuge on an altar is also depicted on Sicilian
    red-figured vases, as for example on a skyphos from Manfria that
    interprets Attic typologies in a peculiar local vein.[^9]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: The mask of the leading slave is documented in the catalogue of
        Julius Pollux, *Onomastikon* 4.148. For a discussion of the
        character of the leading slave, see <span
        class="smcaps">Webster 1995</span>, vol. 1, pp.
        26–29, 229–32; the character is presented in the pose corresponding
        to Webster’s iconographic scheme a2. See also <span
        class="smcaps">Bernabò Brea 1981</span>, pp.
        201–3; and <span class="smcaps">Portale</span>
        2008, pp. 33–35. On the origin and development of the mask, see T.
        B. L. Webster, “Leading Slaves in New Comedy, 300 <span

        class="smcaps">AD,”</span> *JdI* 76 (1961), pp.
        100–10; for the evolution of the type in Attica, see D. Burr
        Thompson, “Three Centuries of Hellenistic Terracottas,” *Hesperia*

        the seated slave continued to be depicted in the Roman period as
        well: see F. Dunand, *Catalogue des terres cuites gréco-romaines
        d’Egypte*: *Musée du Louvre, Départment des antiquités égyptiennes*
        (Paris, 1990), p. 219, no. 600. See also the seated slave in the
        same position in a Graeco-Egyptian two-wick oil lamp, datable
