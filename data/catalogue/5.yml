  :description: |2
    The male head is set on a thick, strong neck and is slightly tilted
    toward the left. The face is full, the forehead is high, the eyes are
    small, set close together, and sunken, with the outer corner downturned;
    the eyelids are thick and the superciliary arches are marked. The nose
    is short and compressed, the mouth is small and tight, with fleshy lips
    and an undulating line; the rounded chin has a hint of a double chin.
    The head is framed by a dense thatch of hair with short, vibrant curls
    held by a tubular band. The back of the head protrudes, and the hair is
    finished in an increasingly irregular and summary manner toward the
    center of the head. There is a circular hole on the nape of the neck.

    The hairstyle of this head, with its curly, short locks, can be seen on
    various types of statues from the Early Hellenistic period. Combined
    with the distinctive rendering of facial features, it appears to be, if
    not a full-fledged portrait, at least a strongly characterized depiction
    of a man.[^1]

    The type is attested in Tarentine coroplastic art of the Early
    Hellenistic period and is comparable to a number of heads of banqueters
    in the collection of the Musei Civici di Trieste; to a statuette that
    forms part of a group of banqueters in a Swiss collection; and to an
    antefix similar to the Getty head in the broad structure of the
    face.[^2] The leonine hairstyle with erect wisps recalls portraits of
    Alexander, which were popular in Magna Graecia, not only in Taranto but
    also in such southern Italian centers as Fratte di Salerno, Capua,
    Teano, and Calvi, and in central Italy.[^3] In particular, the short
    curls are reminiscent of those on a male head that formed part of the
    decoration of the temple at the sanctuary of Lo Scasato at Falerii,
    dating to the beginning of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, in which Italiote and
    possibly Tarentine components have been identified.[^4] The treatment of
    the locks also seems to reflect a Skopasian influence in the context of
    the stylistic eclecticism that was characteristic of the Tarentine
    coroplastic production.[^5] The fine locks of curly hair and the type of
    tubular ribbon that gathers the hair can also be found in heads of
    athletes.[^6] On the basis of established comparisons, the Getty head
    can be dated to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>

    #### Notes

    [^1]: The portrait value of a number of terracotta heads from the second
        half of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> has been analyzed, as
        regards the central Italic area, by Steingräber who sees in them
        well characterized types instead of genuine physiognomic likenesses:
        S. Steingräber, “Zum Phänomen der etruskisch-italischen Votivköpfe,”
        *RM* 87 (1980), pp. 215–53.

    [^2]: See, for instance, H. Herdejürgen, “Tarantinischer Terrakotten der
        Sammlung Schwitter,” *AntK* 16 (1973), pp. 53–108, no. 97, and the
        Tarentine heads in <span class="smcaps">Poli</span> 2010, cat. 443–44.
        For the antefix, which can be dated to the second half of the fourth
        century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, see <span class="smcaps">Carafa
        </span> 1996, pp. 273–94, fig. 9; a resemblance in how the features are
        portrayed can also be detected in a head from the Contrada Corti Vecchie,
        datable to the middle of the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC
        </span>, in <span class="smcaps">Iacobone</span> 1988, pl. 104d, p.
        112; further comparison can be made with a bust from a cult area of
        ancient Forentum, dating to the beginning of the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>: see A. Bottini and P. G.
        Guzzo, “Busti divini da Lavello,” *BdA* 77 (1992), pp. 1–10. See
        also a fictile statue of a youthful masculine type “in the
        Hellenistic tradition” originally from Eboli, which can be bracketed
        between the fourth and the third century centuries <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>: M. Cipriani, “Eboli preromana: I dati
        archeologici: Analisi e proposte di lettura,” in M. Tagliente, ed.,
        *Italici in Magna Grecia: Lingua, insediamenti e strutture*, Leukania 3
        (Venosa, 1991), pp. 119–45, pl. XLVIII, no. 3.

        area, see [cat. 18](18). For the Campanian area, see <span
        class="smcaps">Greco and Pontrandolfo</span>
        1990*,* fig. 159, pp. 104–5, particularly a male head datable to the
        third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> with
        a type of curly hairstyle similar to that of the Getty piece. See
        also the terracotta head of Herakles from Teano dating to the end of
        the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>
        in W. Johannowsky, “Relazione preliminare sugli scavi di Teano*,”
        BdA* 48 (1963), pp. 131–65, fig. 13g–h.

    [^4]: For the male head from Falerii dating to the end of the fourth or
        the beginning of the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> and believed to be the
        work of craftsmen probably originally from Magna Graecia, see A. M.
        Comella*, Le terrecotte architettoniche del santuario dello Scasato
        a Falerii* (Naples, 1993), pp. 107–9, pl. 34a.

    [^5]: The curly hair recalls the statuary type of Meleager: see <span
        class="smcaps">Todisco</span> 1993, p. 87, figs.
        151–53; this hairstyle also seems reminiscent of a marble head of a
        heroicized deceased individual produced in Taras at the end of the
        fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span> in
        <span class="smcaps">Belli Pasqua</span> 1995, pp.
        80–81.

    [^6]: See, for instance, the Ephesus-type athlete: <span
        class="smcaps">Todisco</span> 1993, pp. 54–55,
        fig. 58; for the bronze statue of the victorious athlete attributed
        to Lysippos or his school, and dating from between 340 and 320 <span
        class="smcaps">BC,</span> see <span
        class="smcaps">Moreno</span> 1995, pp. 68–73. A
        type of tubular or rolled headband is also present in the portraits
        of Hellenistic monarchs: see R. R. R. Smith, *Hellenistic Royal
        Portraits* (Oxford, 1988), pp. 34–35.
