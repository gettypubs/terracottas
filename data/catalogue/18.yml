    This head, depicting a young male, is tilted toward the left. The face
    is lean and elongated, and the eyes are almond-shaped, irregular, and
    asymmetrical, with thick eyelids. The nose is straight and wide at the
    base; the lips are well shaped; the lower lip is fleshier than the
    upper. The low forehead is framed by flame-shaped locks of hair that are
    defined by narrow, deep incisions; the locks begin in the center of the
    forehead and spread out on either side of the face, leaving the ears
    uncovered. An incised line divides the nape of the neck into two parts,
    and the locks in the back are rendered only through roughly molded
    shapes. The hairstyle, with the wavy hair pushed back as if the figure
    were in motion, is reminiscent of the head of Pyrrhus in the limestone
    metope depicting a battle scene from the Doric frieze of a *naiskos*
    datable to around 270 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>—a
    readaptation of the motif of a horseman striking from a rearing horse,
    formerly on the monument commemorating the Battle of the Granicus fought
    between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire in 334 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, carved by Lysippos.[^1] This
    type of hairstyle seems to link to the portraiture of Alexander, a
    source of inspiration for coroplasts in the Tarentine area and diffused
    through various versions in Magna Graecia and Etruria in the third
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> Close
    analogies to this wavy hair can be found in a Tarentine antefix. The
    method of rendering the hair through deeply incised curly locks is also
    present, though in more rigid form, in other iconographies that were
    widespread in the Tarentine area between the middle of the fourth and
    the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, as
    can be seen, for example, in a Gorgon-head antefix now in the British
    Museum and in a fragment of a mask depicting Pan from Monte Sannace.[^2]
    The expression of pathos, the low forehead, the fine, low eyebrows, and
    the accentuated tilt of the head are also reminiscent of a male head
    dating to the beginning of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> and assignable to the
    pediment decoration of the sanctuary at Lo Scasato in Falerii, in which
    a Tarentine component has been acknowledged.[^3] The Getty head might
    date from around the first half of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>
