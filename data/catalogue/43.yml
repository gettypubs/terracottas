    Orange in color (Munsell 7.5 yr 7/4), friable and fairly well purified,
    with small reflective inclusions; extensive traces of polychromy over a
    thick layer of white ground: brownish red (hair), pink (complexion,
    himation, and chiton), light blue (leaves of the wreath), and red (mouth).[^1]
    The body and head were made with two bivalve molds. There are two small
    holes on the shoulder and an oval-shaped hole in the back.[^2]

    [^1]: The undercoat for the polychromy, as found in other examples, is
        made of unfired kaolinite; see F. Van der Wielen-van Ommeren, “La
        céramique hellénistique de Canosa: Techniques de fabrication,” in
        <em>Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Ancient Greek and Related
        Pottery, Copenhagen, August 31–September 4, 1987</em> (Copenhagen,
        1988), pp. 665–73.

    [^2]: For the presence of holes on the shoulders, see the example in
        <span class="smcaps"><em>Ceramiques antiques</em> 1987,</span> no. 107,
        said to be for the insertion of small metal ornaments.

    The statuette depicts a draped female figure in a standing position,
    resting her weight on the left leg, while the right leg is bent and
    drawn back. The left arm is folded against the side while the right hand
    holds the himation in the front. The himation completely envelops the
    body, with a fold that drapes over the left shoulder. On the lower part
    of the body, beneath the cloak, is the pink chiton with heavy, ample
    folds. The oval face is painted pink, with regular facial features; the
    lips of the small mouth preserve traces of red pigment. Parted in the
    middle, the hair is combed to either side in wavy locks that form a
    chignon at the nape of the neck; atop the head is a diadem and wreath of
    ivy leaves. The small eyes turn downward; the figure wears spherical
    earrings.

    The statuette is a product of Canosa from the end of the fourth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC</span> to the beginning or the
    third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, based on
    numerous statuettes from this Daunian center with comparable typology,
    fabric, and polychromy. The figure echoes a type, inspired by the
    production of Tanagra, with a characteristic ivy wreath, which can be
    traced back to a Dionysian model; the arrangement of the himation
    gathered in the front was a widespread motif in Taranto, and recurs also
    in various examples from Campania.[^1] Standing draped female statuettes
    were also utilized as attachments on large polychrome vases with plastic
    decoration made in Canosa, datable between the end of the fourth century
    and the beginning of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For the presence of the Tanagra repertoire in Canosa, see V. Jeammet,
      “Entre tradition grecque et indigène: Canosa,” in <span class="smcaps">
      Jeammet 2003</span>b, pp. 290–91. See also the statuettes from Canosa in
      <span class="smcaps"><em>Ceramiques antiques</em> 1987,</span> nos. 139,
      144, and 145, and from Taranto in <span class="smcaps">Besques</span>
      1986, pl. 24e, datable to the beginning of the third century
      <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, with the spool base typical of Tarentine
      production. Also see the statuette, from the third quarter of the third
      century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span> from the funerary deposit of a
      tomb on the Via Tito Livio, in A. dell’Aglio and D. Graepler,
      “Découverte d’une tombe à Tarente,” in <span class="smcaps">Jeammet
      2003</span>b*,* pp. 285–89, no. 226. See also a small draped female
      figure from Cuma from the second half of the fourth to the first half of
      the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in
      <span class="smcaps">Bonghi Jovino</span> 1990, pp. 65–96, pl. I, nos.
      1–3, a type also found at Minturno and at Capua.
