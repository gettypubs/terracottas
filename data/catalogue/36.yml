    The bull is depicted heading to the left with its head tilted in
    three-quarter view. The left front hoof is raised, and the back right
    hoof extends forward; the tail curves around full circle. There is a
    hole pierced through at the bull’s neck. A comparable example was found
    in Tomb 1 in Contrada Tesoro in Taranto.[^1]
