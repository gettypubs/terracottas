    On a pair of altars connected with the mystery cult of Adonis in Magna
    Graecia, reliefs show the beautiful youth seated between by his rival lovers
    Aphrodite and Persephone and dancing female attendants. Fated to die and be
    reborn each year, Adonis was associated with the life cycle of fertility and
    regeneration.

    Reddish in color (Munsell 10 r 6/6–8/6) with numerous micaceous, sandy,
    carbonous, and calcareous inclusions of medium and large sizes; the clay
    is gray at the core. Pigments were applied over a layer of yellowish diluted
    clay and white slip.

    Red (hair of the seated male figure in the center and of the female figure
    seated on the *cista*), and green pigment (drapery of the seated female
    figure in the middle).

    The altars were reassembled from numerous fragments, and the polychromy is
    almost entirely worn away. Before acquisition, they were probably subjected
    to an excessively aggressive cleaning that abraded the surface at several
    points. Nevertheless, large areas of a pale slip remain, over which traces
    of pigments can be seen. Slight amounts of soil/carbonate incrustations are
    also visible, especially in folds and details of the figures.

    by 1984–1986, Robin Symes (London, England), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum,
    1986.
