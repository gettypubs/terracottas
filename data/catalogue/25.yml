  :description: |2
    The standing young female figure bears the weight of her body on her
    left leg. Her right foot rests on the base of the small pillar with a
    rectangular cross-section, and her right hand rests on a capital. The
    head is turned slightly to the left; her left arm extends down her side
    and is covered by the *chlaina* that falls behind her, leaving her
    shoulders uncovered. She wears a high-waisted chiton that drops in soft
    folds, emphasizing the pose, which is characterized by a turn of the
    hip. Her hair, parted into six large clumps, in keeping with the
    so-called melon coiffure, is gathered into a low bun; on her head is a
    wreath of ivy leaves, with a circular element in the center. Her oval
    face has a small, fleshy mouth and a prominent nose; she wears large
    circular earrings.

    This figure belongs to the extensive typology of the female figure
    leaning against a small pillar, comparable to Tanagra figurines, which
    developed from Boeotia in the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> This typology became
    increasingly common also in Magna Graecia,[^1] in particular at
    Taranto,[^2] where it was commonly used for generic portrayals of
    Aphrodite, maenads, or partially draped reclining female figures. These
    figures rarely, if ever, provide clear indications that would identify
    their cult. The compositional scheme of diverging masses, characterized
    by the contrast between the upper and lower parts of the body, only
    hinted at in this case, was utilized in the early examples of leaning
    figures, in which the intention of establishing the figures with
    unstable equilibrium can be seen. At Taranto, in particular, two types
    of female statuettes leaning on small pillars were especially
    widespread. The first is dressed in a high-belted chiton with the head
    crowned as in this statuette, and it may be depicted also with a
    tympanon or simply standing.[^3] The second consists of partially draped
    or nude female figures identified with Aphrodite; these would continue
    to be produced until the end of the second century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^4]

    The statuette finds comparisons among examples that can be dated between
    the fourth century and the middle of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> It shows extensive traces of
    the original polychromy, characterized by strongly contrasting hues, in
    keeping with the local style.[^5]
