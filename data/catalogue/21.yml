    Light beige color (Munsell 10 yr 8/3), purified, friable, porous, with
    occasional reflective particles. Extensive traces of polychromy on a layer
    of white slip: red (hair), pink (flesh).
  :condition: >
    The head, the attachment of the right shoulder, and the right section of the
    bust are preserved; a number of gaps can be noted on the nape of the neck
    and the top of the head. The surface appears to be worn and it is covered
    with a layer of incrustation. Some of the torso’s sections were repaired,
    and the outside joins were inpainted to mask the joins; this inpainting may
    explain the unusual surface quality and color in these areas.
  :provenance: >
    – 1982, Antike Kunst Palladion (Basel, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul Getty
    Museum, 1982.

    The bust once belonged to a statue of a male figure, probably a
    banqueter. The head, in three-quarter view, is also tilted slightly to
    the right. The face is oval and elongated; the eyes, with clearly marked
    borders, have their outer corners turned downward; the eyebrows extend
    in an arch out to the temples. The nose is thin and straight, with a
    flat dorsal ridge; the mouth is small, with fleshy lips; the chin is
    pronounced, and there is a dimple between the chin and the lower lip. The
    hair on the forehead is rendered in fine, sparse locks. This gives the
    head, at least in its present configuration, an almost bald appearance,
    while the hair at the nape is portrayed more clearly; from the central
    part, the hair extends out in parallel waves. The well-shaped ears must
    have been left uncovered. The pectoral muscles are marked by slight
    gradations. The bust seems to have been conceived to be seen
    foreshortened and from below, as attested by the notable asymmetries
    between the two halves of the face, with the eyes differing in size and
    level and the central facial axis shifted to the right, making one half
    of the face more prominent.[^1]

    The head presents a number of characteristics that can be found in
    Tarentine coroplastic types from the end of the fifth century to the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, such
    as the lean, elongated face; the sharply outlined eyelids; the sad,
    lowered gaze; and the chiaroscuro formed by the shadow beneath the
    eyebrows. These elements recur in many small-format statuettes of
    banqueters datable to the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>.[^2] In this bust, the rigid
    frontality present in many earlier examples has been attenuated in favor
    of a looser, more expressive pose. The locks of hair arranged in a
    parallel, horizontal manner on the nape of the neck recur in
    Lysippan-style sculpture that probably flowed into the eclectic
    stylistic vocabulary of the Tarentine coroplasts.[^3]

    The identification of this piece as a figure of a banqueter is
    especially persuasive based on comparisons with other nude male busts of
    reclining figures in Tarentine contexts of the late fifth century and
    the fourth century centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> The iconography of the
    reclining figure, attested by terracotta finds in the various
    votive deposits of the city, is characterized especially by complicated
    floral wreaths and bands. From an examination of the Tarentine
    typologies, it is evident how the coroplasts could diversify production even while
    working from relatively standardized types. In some cases,
    they endowed the figures with individualized facial features.[^4]

    The theme of the reclining figure has given rise to a number of
    hypotheses as to the origin and identification of the male and female
    characters in relation to heroic, Orphic, and chthonic cults. Some have
    interpreted this figure as the very act of the completed sacrifice,
    achieved through the depiction of the faithful.[^5]

    In Macedonian wall painting of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, whose similarity to the
    painting of Magna Graecia has already been pointed out, participants in
    the symposion are depicted as bare-chested and are characterized by a
    lively set of gestures.[^6]

    <span class="smcaps">Appendix:</span> The piece had been broken and repaired before the Getty Museum acquired
    it. A thermoluminescence test conducted at the Research Laboratory for
    Archaeology and the History of Art at Oxford confirmed that the
    terracotta is of ancient manufacture.

        same pattern of locks of hair brushed forward from the nape of the
        neck can be found in a number of heads of young boys painted on
        Volterran vases, which also refer back to Lysippan types; in this
        connection, see G. Hafner, “Männer- und Junglingsbilder aus
