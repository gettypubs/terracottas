    Reddish in color (Munsell 10 r 6/6–8/6) with numerous micaceous, sandy,
    carbonous, and calcareous inclusions of medium and large sizes; the clay
    is gray at the core. Pigments were applied over a layer of yellowish
    diluted clay and white slip.

    Sporadic traces of red (hair of the figure on the left), reddish brown
    (drapery of the same figure), and green pigment (musical instrument of the
    figure in the middle and drapery of the figure on the right).

    The altars were reassembled from numerous fragments, and the polychromy is
    almost entirely worn away. Before acquisition, they were probably subjected
    to an excessively aggressive cleaning that abraded the surface at several
    points. Nevertheless, large areas of a pale slip remain, over which traces
    of pigments can be seen. Slight amounts of soil/carbonate incrustations
    are also visible, especially in folds and details of the figures.
  :provenance: >
    By 1984–1986, Robin Symes (London, England), sold to the J. Paul Getty
    Museum, 1986.
