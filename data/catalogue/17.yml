    The head, turned to the left, presents an elongated face with oval eyes
    and thickened eyelids, straight nose and fleshy lips (especially the
    lower one), a full chin, and a short neck. The hair is treated as large
    locks applied to the head, separated by sharp, deep cuts, arranged
    radially around the face, and hanging on either side of the face in
    tubular curls. At the nape of the neck, there is a wide, irregularly
    shaped hole. The physiognomy of the face is reminiscent of Tarentine
    examples dating to the middle and second half of the fourth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and characterized by a
    somber expression accentuated by the tilt of the head. The hairstyle and
    the tubular ringlets are more unusual. A head in Copenhagen, dating to
    the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, presents the same tilt, the
    regular facial features, and the hair treated in molded modules, clumped
    roughly over the forehead, and articulated by a potter’s tool.[^1] In
    central Italy, such so-called Libyan ringlets can be found in a number
    of heads with elongated faces datable between the late fourth and the
    third century centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> These heads have been linked
    with a number of Tarentine antefixes dating to the beginning of the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, as well
    as with funerary sculptures of the second half of the fourth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, though the ringlets in
    that case are arranged vertically on either side of the face in groups
    of two or three.[^2] In the context of the third century, this type of
    hairstyle seems reminiscent of that of Isis, adopted by Egyptian queens.
    Two terracotta female heads now in the Louvre, similar to the head of
    Demeter Isis on the Farnese Cup (Tazza Farnese) in Naples, offer
    significant comparisons. A high-relief of Aphrodite-Berenice, found in
    the agora of Cyrene and alluding to the marriage between Berenice and
    Ptolemy III Euergetes (performed in 246 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>), shows potential affinities
    in the tilt of the head and in the hairstyle.[^3]

    The lack of more exact comparisons to the Getty head means that no
    precise dating is possible. In stylistic terms, the head can be
    generically attributed to the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, the period of most of the
    comparable facial features from the Tarentine area, but the possibility
    that, given the type of hairstyle, this head might date to around the
    middle of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> should not be ruled out<span
    class="smcaps">.</span>

        already be found in the late fifth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>, as for instance, a head
        in a frontal position in <span
