    Beige in color with light green nuances (Munsell 2.5 yr 8/3–8/4), highly
    purified, porous, and friable in consistency. Surface covered with a layer
    of slip of diluted clay. Polychromy: traces of red color on the hair and ocher
    on the forehead.

    Preserved are the head, neck, and part of the tenon for insertion into the
    torso; a small portion of a wreath remains behind the nape of the neck.
    The nose is chipped. The surface is covered with incrustations that conceal
    the surviving traces of paint.

  :description: |2
    The head formed part of a statue, as is shown by the tenon, still
    preserved at the base of the broad, flared neck, which was used to
    attach the head to the figure’s bust. The back portion of the head shows
    hasty, summary modeling; the wreath and hair were applied separately
    before the firing. A circular opening can be seen in the back of the
    neck.

    The face is round and full, the eyes have thickened eyelids that are
    asymmetrical and irregular in shape; the mouth, barely half open, has
    fleshy lips. The hair is parted in a “pincer” style over the forehead
    and arranged around the face with lively locks defined by fine
    striations. The head must once have had a headdress with bands that fell
    on either side of the face and a wreath: a distinctive element in the
    typology of banqueters to which this head is linked. A number of heads
    of statuettes of banqueters from Taranto wear wreaths with rosettes
    topped by a complicated floral *fastigium* (crown).[^1] The most
    distinctive element is the hairstyle, in which it is possible to
    recognize a Polykleitan influence that extended in Taras even beyond the
    fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] The
    head, larger than other comparable heads (which generally belong to
    medium-sized statuettes), presents a nesting system by means of which it
    was inserted into the body of the statue, a technique not unusual in
    coroplastic workshops.[^3]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: There are numerous comparisons with statuettes of varying sizes
        from the Tarentine context, for example: <span
        class="smcaps">Iacobone 1988</span>, pp. 95–96,
        pl. 90a–b, head and bust of banqueters from the votive deposits of
        the Via Di Palma and of Contrada Corti Vecchie, datable to the first
        half of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>; the statuette from the
        votive deposit of the Via Di Palma, inv. 200354 in the Museo
        Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto; and the piece in <span
        class="smcaps">Caporusso 1975</span>, no. 14, pl.
        IX, from the end of the fifth to the beginning of the fourth century
        <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> Dating to the same
        period is a head with traces of red color on the hair; see <span
        class="smcaps">Leyenaar-Plaisier 1979</span>, vol.
        1, no. 155, pl. 27; <span
        class="smcaps">Breitenstein 1941</span>, p. 17,
        no. 10; <span class="smcaps">Herdejürgen 1971</span>, no. 25, fig. 9; <span
        class="smcaps">Levi 1926</span>, fig. 38, no. 141;
        <span class="smcaps">Bartoccini 1936</span>, p. 158, fig.
        56 (head of a banqueter with the same arrangement of locks
        of hair from a votive deposit in Contrada Corti Vecchie); the head
        from the Fondo Giovinazzi in Taranto, from the late fourth century
        <span class="smcaps">BC</span> in <span
        class="smcaps">Higgins 1954</span>, pl. 176, nos.
        1284–85; and the unpublished piece now in the Musei Civici di
        Trieste, <span class="smcaps">Poli 2010a</span>, p. 241,
        cat. 376, from the end of the fifth to the beginning of the
        fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> See
        also the Metapontine head in <span
        class="smcaps">Letta 1971</span>, pp. 84–86, pl. XII, no. 3. A metal wreath imitating a braiding of branches,
        garlands, and festoons was also found among grave goods. It is
        generally considered to be related to eschatological beliefs. For
        the headgear, see also head at [cat. 21](../21/).

    [^2]: In this connection, consider the Herakles by Polykleitos: P. C.
        Bol, *Polyklet: Der Bildhauer der griechischen Klassik*, exh. cat.
        (Frankfurt, Museum Alter Plastik, 1993), pp. 199–205, characterized
        by hair in short locks, flattened and adhering to the skull. This
        creation can be assigned to the artist’s maturity.

    [^3]: From Lucera, compare the head dating to the end of the fourth
        century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, possibly
        originally part of a full-size figure, in <span
        class="smcaps">D’Ercole 1990</span>, p. 69, pl.
        13a.
