    The *clipeus* (plaque) presents a beaded edge with a head of Medusa
    (gorgoneion), characterized by pathetic traits, applied in high relief
    just above the center. The Medusa is facing very slightly to the right,
    with wreath wings on her head. Her undulating snaky hair, parted in the
    center, flows back on either side of the face; the face is full, and the
    orbital area is rather marked; the mouth is small and fleshy. On her
    neck, she wears a tubular necklace with a pendant at the center; beneath
    it is a pair of intertwined snakes, also encircling her neck. Three
    concentric rows of scales of increasing size, with a central rib,
    radiate out from the head. There are two suspension holes on the head.

    This Medusa-head *clipeus* can be assigned to a well-known production
    from Centuripe, widespread, in the Hellenistic period, in Magna Graecia
    and in a number of centers in southeastern Sicily, such as Morgantina.
    In Centuripe and Morgantina, *clipei* with gorgoneia were found
    primarily in contexts dating from the third to the first centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1]

    In Centuripe, especially, the iconographic motif adheres to constant
    schemes and can also be found in the vases of the time, often decorated
    with small Gorgon heads applied in relief and characterized also by a
    similar use and distribution of polychromy. The iconographic scheme was
    then varied by differences in the treatment of such elements as the
    hairstyle, the wings, or the snakes.[^2] Despite the fact that the role
    of the Gorgon in the Hellenistic period was largely decorative, its
    apotropaic significance must have persisted, given that, especially in
    Centuripe, it remained one of the most popular iconographic motifs for
    the decoration of vases and objects intended for funerary deposits.
    These terracotta *clipei*, which served as *oscilla* (small offerings
    meant to swing in the wind), seem to have been derived from metal
    prototypes; in Centuripe, there are reports of gilt-silver *clipei*
    showing a bust of a maenad in three-quarter view.[^3]

        928–30, pl. 138, dating from the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> and assignable to the
        production of the Catania Group; and <span
        class="smcaps">Schürmann</span> 1989, nos. 975–76,

        For two *clipei* with gorgoneia from the Hellenistic necropolis of
        Cefalù, datable to the second century <span

        terrecotte figurate,” in A. Tullio, *Cefalù: La necropoli
        ellenistica*, vol. 1 (Palermo, 2008), pp. 121–26, TC 61–62, pl.
        XXVII, nos. 3–4. The dispersal of the material from Centuripe onto
        the antiquities market is evidenced by the numerous pieces that have
        appeared in auction catalogues; see, for instance: *Antiquities,* W.
        and F. C. Bonham and Sons (Knightsbridge)*,* sale cat., November 26,
