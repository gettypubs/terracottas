    Light beige in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/3), with a talcous and porous
    consistency, many reflective particles, and infrequent calcareous inclusions.
    The head was made with a bivalve mold, evidenced by a seam dividing the
    front and the back sections; the ears were separately applied over the seam.
    In the back, the clay is bright orange in color (Munsell 5 yr 7/6); the
    surface was covered by a layer of slip consisting of beige diluted clay.
  :condition: >
    Intact; the nose and the left ear are chipped; there are diffuse dark
    incrustations on the surfaces of the exterior and interior. See Appendix
    under “Description,” below for additional observations.
  :provenance: >
    – 1982, Antike Kunst Palladion (Basel, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul
    Getty Museum, 1982.

  :description: |2
    The head of the young man is set on a broad neck that tapers from the
    base; it tilts slightly to the left. The face is full; the large eyes
    have sharply outlined eyelids; the mouth is half-open with fleshy lips,
    the thick ears are set forward, and the nose is broad at the base with
    pierced nostrils. The hair is parted in the middle and arranged in
    short, fine, wavy locks around the face, presenting a bifurcation of the
    two central locks of hair in the middle of the forehead. There is a
    regular-shaped circular hole above the left ear and another small hole
    above the upper lip. On the nape of the neck, the hair is arranged on
    either side of a central part in tousled, parallel locks, defined by
    cuts. From the arrangement of the hair, one may conjecture that a band
    or a wreath was set on the head.[^1] Beneath the ears, one can see the
    seam that divides the two parts of the head. The eyes, mouth, dimple
    beneath the nose, and hair have all been finished with a sharp tool.

    The face does not feature a typical childish smile; it seems rather to
    have the appearance of an adolescent. The closest comparison is with a
    Tarentine head in Basel, dated to the end of the fifth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> It presents similar facial
    characteristics, such as the rendering of the hair, the fleshy mouth,
    and the structure of the head, as well as similar technical details,
    such as the hole above the ears. The hairstyle is slightly different
    because in this example the locks of hair are finer and more sparse.[^2]
    The jug ears, the pudgy face, and the hairstyle distinguish the
    iconography of the boy or young man in later instances as well.[^3] The
    Getty head, perhaps later than the one in Basel, can be dated to the
    first half of the fourth century <span

    #### Appendix

    The conical shape of the hole tapering toward the object’s interior
    indicates that a pointed instrument was inserted into the soft clay and
    then turned in a circular fashion to enlarge the hole. If this were
    modern, the hole would have been cut into hardened clay, using tools
    such as drill bits, which would have left a distinctive crisp edge at
    the entrance and interior exit of the hole. Instead, both have a soft,
    rounded edge, which is expected with manipulation in soft clay. Equally,
    the interior surface of the hole appears identical to the exterior and
    interior clay surfaces of the object. If the hole were recent, the
    interior surface would have been very smooth and different in appearance
    from the rest of the object’s surface.

    The texture and thickness of the obscuring soil incrustation is very
    even on both exterior and interior, drawing some suspicion. Its strong
    attachment to the terracotta surface, evidenced in the area at the base
    of the neck where mechanical cleaning has been attempted, seems to
    indicate high clay content. Examination under ultraviolet light aided in
    this interpretation, showing no presence of pigments or organic binders.
    Examination under visible light in normal conditions and magnification
    shows areas where the clay incrustation is entirely lacking, which is
    more consistent with deposition rather than modern application. In these
    areas—many of which are high points of relief, such as the edge of the
    ears and tops of the hair—the clay and some of the terracotta seem to
    have been removed through abrasion. If the clay were applied in recent
    times, such areas would presumably present a different appearance, with
    the clay smoothly transitioning to reveal the underlying terracotta,
    which would most likely be little affected.

    #### Notes

    [^1]: One cannot prove that this figure originally wore a wreath, but
        the presence of adolescents among banqueters is attested, for
        instance in Sparta, where young men could attend certain parts of
        the banquet. In this case, there was likely an emphasis on the
        transition from the state of *pais* (child) to the state of *aner*
        (man). On this, see P. Schmitt Pantel, *La cité au banquet: Histoire
        des repas publics dans les cités grecques*, Collection de l’école
        française de Rome 157 (Rome, 1992), pp. 77–78; and R. Buxton,
        *Imaginary Greece: The Contexts of Mythology* (Cambridge \[U.K.\],
        1994), pp. 21–44. Especially meaningful here is the find in Taranto
        of a tomb of a child buried with a silver headband with applied
        rosettes and a set composed of a skyphos and a strigil; see P. G.
        Guzzo, “Corone d’agone, tra guerra e morte, in Magna Grecia,” in
        <span class="smcaps">La Regina 2003,</span> pp.
