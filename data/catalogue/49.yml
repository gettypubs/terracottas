    The *arula*, parallelepiped in shape, is squared off with rectangular
    cornices at the top and the base, above which a thin fillet serves as a
    ground line for the figures. The underside was hollowed out in order to
    reduce the weight and to facilitate firing. The four faces are decorated
    with molded figures of animals in low relief, which were finished with a
    potter’s rib.[^1] The letters ΔΙΟ (Dionysos) are inscribed on the top
    surface.[^2]

    On the front, a griffin advances toward the right, confronting the lioness
    on the adjacent side with its left front paw lifted and wings spread;
    they are attached at the shoulder and defined by incised, elongated
    feathers; the left (back) wing appears in profile beneath the creature’s
    head. The anatomical parts are stylized, especially the long, flexing
    body and the S-curved tail, which belong to the Archaic tradition.[^3]

    On the right side, a goat is depicted in a stationary stance facing left, with
    front and back legs joined and firmly planted on the ground. The
    animal’s head is lowered, with the muzzle pressed against its chest as
    if preparing to charge the panther on the adjacent side. The goat has
    delicate horns that curve back along the neck, a short upturned tail, a
    prominent phallus, and fleece rendered in small, wavy locks.

    On the back, a panther moves toward the right, with its left paw raised.
    The body is sinuous and arched, with a well-defined attachment of the
    back left leg; the long tail twists and curves upward in a sigmate
    shape.

    On the left side, a lioness faces left with her right front paw raised. Her
    body is long, narrowing at the middle, and the fur is rendered in a
    stylized manner with short, flame-shaped locks; the tail and the
    attachment of the back leg are similar to the preceding figure.

    This type of *arula*—small in size, made from a block of clay, and
    decorated with animals and mythological creatures—is widespread in Magna
    Graecia, especially in Metaponto,[^4] Caulonia,[^5] and Locri,[^6] and
    is generally dated to the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> There are significant ties
    between the four animals and the deity to whom the *arula* was to be
    dedicated: the griffin, the panther, the lioness, and the goat, in fact,
    frequently accompany Dionysos and his entourage. The association with
    the griffin and the panther seems to be documented as far back as the
    end of the fifth century, as documented by Apulian vases. The griffin
    seems to be more closely affiliated with a type of chthonic Dionysos
    that is probably of Thracian-Phrygian origin.[^7]

    In Sicily, too, as early as in the Archaic period, *arulae* with
    depictions of animals have been found, evidence of the early
    assimilation by the colonial world of iconographic motifs from the Greek
    and Eastern regions, motifs that, through the medium of vases as well,
    persist over time without any particular stylistic development.
    Likewise, a number of Archaic formal conventions, such as the S-shaped
    tails, found also in small Laconian or Corinthian bronzes diffused in
    the West, would continue to appear for a long time.[^8] The most
    pertinent comparison is with a number of *arulae* from Metaponto that
    present the same typology and subjects, though they are arranged in a
    different order; the use of individual molds allowed a certain
    decorative variety within a substantially repetitive production.[^9]

    There is some debate over the origin of this type: Pierre Wuilleumier
    believed it could be assigned to Tarentine production due to its
    similarity to subjects found in appliqués or in imitations of gilded
    terracotta costume jewelry, as well as in Apulian vases. Other scholars
    believe the type could be more properly assigned to the area of
    Metaponto, especially due to the quantity of pieces found in that
    area.[^10]

    [^8]: From Gela, there is an *arula* with a front panel depicting a
