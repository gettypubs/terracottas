    The solidly structured head is tilted slightly to one side; the face is
    squared off and full, characterized by a determined jaw. The low
    forehead is framed by a hairstyle made up of large locks of densely
    striated hair, parted in the middle and arranged around the two sides of
    the forehead, covering the upper parts of the ears. The asymmetrical
    eyes are globular, with marked irises. The slightly lowered eyelids are
    thick, with a well-defined silhouette. The nose is short, and the mouth,
    tightly closed, has fleshy lips with clear outlines. The chin has a
    dimple that also defines the connection between the lower lip and the
    chin.

    The head, probably dating to the end of the fifth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC,</span> presents the usual formal
    features of Severe-style sculpture, such as the heavy jaw and the
    hairstyle with broad distinct locks of hair arranged over the forehead
    and combed in a roll just suggested behind the nape of the neck. The
    same distinctive linear style appears in many other Severe-style works
    from Sicily and Magna Graecia dating from the fifth century to the first
    half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1] In sculpture, this type
    of hairstyle is reminiscent of the figure of Actaeon in the metope of
    the Temple E at Selinunte, the marble ephebe from Agrigento, and the
    bronze ephebe of Selinunte from 470 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, and it is also comparable in
    the Attic context to the Ephebe attributable to Kritios from Athens.[^2]
    In small statuary, the tightly rolled puff at the nape of the neck,
    present also on female heads (see [cat. 9](9) and [10](10)), can be found in
    numerous small bronzes and, with an especially calligraphic rendering,
    is very common in various coroplastic types of the Severe style.[^3] The
    evolution of hairstyles can also be traced in coins of Southern Italy
    and Sicily from the fifth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^4]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For the rendering of the facial features, in particular for the
        chin and pronounced jaw, see the head of a banqueter dating to the
        end of the fifth century BC in <span
        class="smcaps">Herdejürger</span> 1982, no. 101,
        p. 41, and the head of a female figure dating to the beginning of
        the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>
        in <span class="smcaps">Iacobone</span> 1988, pl.
        72a, p. 79. For the structure of the face, see the marble head of a
        youth in A. Giuliano, ed., *Museo Nazionale Romano: Le sculture*
        (Rome, 1995), vol. 1, pp. 7–9, which can be traced back to a
        Peloponnesian bronze archetype of the Severe style.

    [^2]: For the head of Actaeon, which presents similar locks divided into
        sections, see C. Marconi, *Selinunte: Le metope dell’Heraion*
        (Modena, 1994), fig. 69. For the bronze ephebe from Castelvetrano,
        near Selinunte, whose hairstyle is also articulated into a series of
        distinct locks of hair, see *<span
        class="smcaps">Lo stile severo</span>* 1990, pp.
        239–41, no. 82, and C. Greco, “Isole nell’Isola: Testimonianze e
        documenti archeologici della provincia di Trapani,” in <span
        class="smcaps">Ampolo</span> 2009, pp. 531–49. For
        the Ephebe from Agrigento and the Ephebe of Kritios, see G.
        Adornato, “L’Efebo di Agrigento: Cultura figurativa e linguaggi
        artistici ad Akragas in età tardoarcaica e protoclassica,”

        sculpture from the fifth century BC, see <span

        for other examples in the coroplastic art, pp. 181–82. For a
        meaningful comparison with a mirror handle in the form of a draped
        man from Locri in the Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria, see F.

        pp. 5–6, no. 7, figs. 22–23.

        Terina, see B. P. R. Franke and M. Hirmer, *Die griechische Münze*
        (Munich, 1964), figs. 95–96 (420–400 BC); and for the tetradrachm
        from Lentini, see <span
