    The Arimasp with a Phrygian cap is portrayed in profile facing to his
    right, with sword unsheathed. He portrayed in the act of striking his
    adversary, probably a griffin, while leaning on the *pelta* set on the
    ground. His right leg is bent and thrust forward, the left kneels on the
    ground, and the bust is rigidly inclined backward. In keeping with the
    iconography of the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, the
    Eastern warrior wears a Phrygian cap, a short chiton belted under the chest
    and, over it, a *chlamys* that, following the warrior’s motions, is lifting
    to one side, forming a series of fluted folds.[^1]

    Arimasps were depicted in Attic products from the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> that are documented in
    Taranto. They are often shown battling griffins and conform to
    conventional iconographic schemes, such as the short tunic, the crescent
    shield, and the pointed hat. In other Tarentine appliqués, Arimasps are
    depicted fighting one or two griffins, a recurring theme both in Apulian
    vase decorations and in Tarentine soft-stone reliefs, which show the
    same fondness for movement, often precarious, and for fluttering
    drapery.[^2] According to the analysis proposed by Weisner, the
    iconography of the Arimasps originated in the Black Sea and in the Greek
    colonies of the Pontos region, and then established itself in Magna
    Graecia and in Taras also, through the intermediary of Metaponto. It
    became a favorite motif among the Pythagoreans inasmuch as it symbolized
    hope for an afterlife.[^3]

        similar to this piece is a relief found in a Tarentine tomb from the
        end of the fourth century <span
