  :fabric: |
    Pinkish in color (Munsell 2.5 yr 7/6), fairly well purified, and friable
    with small reflective inclusions, covered with a thick layer of paste
    composed of milk of lime. Sporadic traces of pink pigment on the animal’s
    muzzle. The body is hollow, except for the hooves. Beneath the ram’s belly
    is a vent fissure.
  :condition: |
    The left back leg has been reassembled from two fragments and the right
    front leg from one fragment. The white milk-of-lime paste has almost
    completely detached and persists only on the head, on the proper left side,
    and on the front hooves. All four legs have breaks.

    The group depicts Odysseus, or one of his companions, fleeing from the grotto
    of the Cyclops Polyphemos by hiding beneath the belly of a ram. The animal
    is rendered in a somewhat stylized manner conceived to be covered by the
    white paste, with a cylindrical body and short stick legs, while the head
    reveals more defined modeling, especially in the rendering of the twisted
    horns and the muzzle.[^1] Of the male figure, only part of the head is shown,
    projecting from between the animal’s front legs, with no indication of a body,
    nor of the arms that in many other depictions of this subject appear gripping
    the animal’s back. The man’s face is oval, with globular eyes; the hair is
    arranged in an arch over the forehead, with small globular ringlets.[^2]
    The animal’s fleece is rendered with a milk-of-lime paste applied to the
    surface of the clay, then smoothed with a tool. The piece is hollow and
    low-fired.

    This Homeric episode, recounted in the ninth book of the *Odyssey*, is one
    of the most recurrent themes in Greek figurative culture. Beginning in the
    Orientalizing period and especially in the Archaic period, the scene was
    frequently rendered not only within the iconographic repertory of Attic
    vases but also in fictile reliefs, appliqués, and bronze tripods.[^3]

    According to literary tradition, Sicily was the homeland of the Cyclopes,
    but the topography of the places described in the Homeric text are still
    very much subject to debate.[^4] Nevertheless, the hero and his wanderings
    were a very common and lively subject within the culture of the colonies of
    Magna Graecia and Sicily.[^5]

    It is possible that a cult of the Greek hero may have arisen as early as
    the Archaic period in the eastern area of Sicily, as seems to be suggested
    by the discovery of an *arula* from Megara Hyblaea, dating from the third
    quarter of the sixth century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span> with a scene
    of Odysseus escaping from the cave of Polyphemos.[^6]

    The Getty statuette, which is reported to have come from Sicily, finds its
    closest comparison with a terracotta now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in
    Copenhagen, which is presumed to come originally from Barrafranca (Enna)
    and is likewise datable to the end of the sixth century <span class="smcaps">
    BC.</span>[^7] Though objective evidence is lacking, the close analogies
    between the two pieces would support the hypothesis that they shared a
    common archaeological context.

    These two statuettes are closely comparable with a number of works in
    bronze: an appliqué with the hero beneath the ram, dating from the second
    half of the sixth century and originally from Delphi; and the handle
    fixtures—of Laconian inspiration—with rams belonging to bronze hydriai
    dating from the middle of the sixth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,
    but also found in the Corinthian milieu after 550 <span class="smcaps">
    BC.</span>[^8]

    #### Appendix

    The piece has been subjected to UV light testing, which did not reveal any
    irregularities.

    #### Notes

    [^1]: In the Archaic period, depictions of rams are often associated
        with Odysseus; see A. J. Heisserer, “An Archaic Greek Bronze
        Ram-Figurine,” *ArchCl* 41 (1989), pp. 383–90.

    [^2]: The face of Odysseus, especially in the rendering of the eyes and
        hair, shows distinctive Archaic characteristics.
