  :description: |2

    The head of a young man is characterized by a long neck that broadens
    toward the base and an elongated oval face with finely defined features.
    The eyebrows are lowered, the eyes are small and regularly shaped, with
    sharply outlined eyelids; the nose is straight; the mouth is nicely
    designed with half-open lips. The smooth hair is parted in the center of
    a broad forehead; the hair is combed forward in small, sparse tufts
    defined by small incisions; the hair leaves the ears uncovered.

    On the back of the neck, in contrast, the hair is rendered in broad,
    flattened locks by simple parallel grooves. There is a regular-shaped
    circular hole in the back, where the neck attaches to the head. The
    face, which presents a number of distinctive features, is characterized
    by a vaguely languid expression emphasized by the half-open lips. This
    type does not appear to be particularly common in the Tarentine area of
    the Hellenistic period. It is possible, however, to make some comparison
    with a head from Taranto now in Musei Civici di Trieste, characterized
    by an especially lean adolescent face, but with a somewhat different
    rendering of the hairstyle; and with two other statuette heads from the
    votive deposits of the Borgo Arsenale Militare and the Via Duca degli
    Abruzzi.[^1] The type of hairstyle, in particular, can be found in
    numerous terracotta heads belonging to the central Italic area and
    datable between the end of the fourth and the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] The long, tubular neck,
    the elongated face, and the hairstyle characterized by flattened locks
    can be linked to some heads from the third and second centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> found in Campania.[^3]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: See the piece in the Musei Civici di Trieste, inv. 4008; also the
        head from the Borgo Arsenale Militare, inv. 200112; and the head
        from the votive deposit of the Via Duca degli Abruzzi, inv. 162845
        in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico di Taranto.

    [^2]: Compare with the terracotta head of a young man in the Museo
        Gregoriano Etrusco Vaticano: S. Ensoli, “Alessandro: L’immagine del
        principe,” in <span class="smcaps">Moreno</span>
        1995, pp. 331–37, fig. 4; for the scheme of the elongated face, see
        also the bust from Lucera discussed in <span
        class="smcaps">D’Ercole</span> 1990, pp. 90–91,
        103, pl. 27b, from the end of the fourth and the third centuries
        <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> The lean face,
        half-open lips, and rapt gaze are also reminiscent of the votive
        terracotta head from the Portonaccio Sanctuary at Veii dating to the
        end of the fifth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>, an early example of a
        typological portrait of an adolescent: F. Roncalli, “L’arte,” in G.
        Pugliese Carratelli and M. Pallottino, eds., *Rasenna: Storia e
        civiltà degli Etruschi* (Milan, 1986), pp. 533–676, esp, p. 655,
        fig. 573.

    [^3]: See the type of the young male head from Capua rendered with less
        exacting workmanship, short hair, and slender, tubular neck,
        discussed in M. Bonghi Jovino, *Terrecotte votive: Catalogo del
        Museo provinciale campano*, 1. *Teste isolate e mezzeteste*, *Capua
        preromana* (Florence, 1965), pl. XLIV, nos. 2–3. From the votive
        deposit of the sanctuary of Minerva Medica in Rome comes a later
        head that can be dated between 100 and 70 <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> and which is reminiscent
        of the Getty piece: see L. Gatti Lo Guzzo, *Il deposito votivo
        dell’Esquilino detto di Minerva Medica* (Florence, 1978), pl. XLI,
        pp. 99–100. For relations between the production in Taras and that
        in southern Etruria and the Italic centers consider the observations
        of S. Ciaghi, “Sulle formazione di un tipologia di teste votive
        etrusco-italiche con particolare riferimento alla produzione
        calena,” in <span class="smcaps">Bonghi
        Jovino</span> 1990, pp. 127–45.
