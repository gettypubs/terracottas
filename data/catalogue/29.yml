    Bright orange in color (Munsell 5 yr 7/8), darker in back (Munsell 7.5 yr 7/6),
    with a friable consistency, and with many reflective and carbonous inclusions.
    Extensive traces of polychromy over a thick layer of white slip: bright pink
    (arms and _kekruphalos_ [hairnet]), light pink (face and legs), and
    red (left foot). The body and the head of the statuette were made with
    bivalve molds, while the arms, legs, and various secondary elements were
    worked freehand and applied to the figure before firing. On the back is a
    circular vent hole.
  :condition: >
    The fingers of the proper right hand and ornamental detail on the hairnet
    are missing, as is much of the white ground layer.

  :description: |2

    The slender character, with skinny arms, stands with its right leg
    slightly bent and tucked behind; the head is turning sharply to the
    left. The left arm is poised on the hip while the right arm is
    outstretched to the side in a declamatory gesture. The figure is wearing
    a short chiton and cloak that covers the shoulders, then crosses over
    behind the back and is rolled up around the waist like a sash.
    Fluttering folds at the sides suggest the figure’s dancelike movement.

    The hair, arranged in an arch over the forehead, is held back by a
    _kekruphalos_, the ends of which are knotted over the forehead. The nose
    is hooked; the large eyebrows are furrowed, forming two creases across
    the forehead, which is marked by a large protuberance; the gaze is grim.

    The chiton and the short cloak rolled over the hips, as well as the
    headdress and the short boots, are specific features of the costume of
    Artemis, in keeping with an iconography that originated in the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and spread
    throughout the Hellenistic period in a number of variants.[^1]

    The arm raised to one side, too, is typical of many statuary types, such
    as the small statue of Artemis from Piraeus, datable to the third
    quarter of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] The hand on the hip is
    also found in various depictions of the goddess, holding either bow and
    quiver or a torch, a recurrent theme in both Hellenistic coroplastic art
    and South Italian vase iconography. In particular, the exaggerated,
    theatrical pose of the character, which seems to parody common
    iconographies of the pugnacious goddess between the fourth century and
    the third century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span>
    might be intended to evoke Artemis herself in the throes of rage over a
    misdeed or in a querulous stance.[^3] In this case, it is likely that
    the figure represents an actor performing in a “phlyax farce” or
    hilarotragedy, in the role of either the goddess or a member of her
    entourage; indeed, phlyax plays owed their popularity to the sort of
    caricatural deformation and grotesque parody that are expressed in this
    figure.[^4]

    Tentatively, this character could be related to the mythological tale of
    Kallisto, the Arcadian nymph who was a follower in Artemis’s virginal
    entourage; Zeus took her as a lover, however, and she bore him a son,
    Arkas; according to a number of sources, Kallisto was then condemned by
    Artemis and transformed into a she-bear. The sad story of Kallisto was
    the subject of a tragedy by Aeschylus, now lost, and a comedy by Amphis.
    Euripides also mentions her in his play *Helen*, but in general the
    literary sources on the nymph are fragmentary and conflicting. Kallisto
    was depicted in a number of red-figured Apulian vases that can be dated
    to a very narrow window of time, from 380 to 360 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, and possibly linked to
    political events that involved Arcadia (the constitution of the Arcadian
    League in 371 <span class="smcaps">BC)</span>. In the
    scenes depicted, probably influenced by literary sources and paintings
    as well, the nymph is presented wearing a long, gauzy chiton that leaves
    the shoulders uncovered or, in some cases, showing incipient feral
    traits that allude to the impending metamorphosis that is her
    punishment. In this case, the statuette could depict Artemis, who
    inflicts the punishment on the nymph with an imperious gesture.[^5]

    It is unclear whether the character is wearing a mask, but according to
    Pollux’s description, the facial features are more reminiscent of the
    mask of a *parasitos* (sponger), especially with a view to the decidedly
    *epigrypos* (aquiline) nose and the furrowed brow with a bump in the
    middle. But the face may also be supposed to represent the mime’s own
    visage, molded through his acting skill and adept use of make-up.[^6]

    The piece, reportedly from Asia Minor, has been ascribed to Myrina,[^7]
    but the figure can also be compared with a number of statuettes from the
    funerary deposits of Taranto, datable between the last quarter of the
    third century and the first quarter of the second century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> This was a period in which
    the coroplastic repertoire was enriched with new typologies
    characterized by flowing movements and by a dynamic placement of the
    figure in space. This statuette can also hypothetically be linked to a
    Tarentine tomb context datable to between the end of the third century
    and the beginning of the second century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, on the basis of stylistic
    comparisons and the type of clay,[^8] and in view of the popularity of
    phlyax farces—especially the plays of Rhinthon, who was active in Taras
    between the end of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> and the beginning of the
    third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>—and their
    influence on Apulian artistic production, in close connection with
    Dionysian funerary ideology.[^9]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For the iconography of Artemis in the Hellenistic period, see
        <span class="smcaps">Kahil</span> 1984, in
        particular for the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>, pp. 747–51; for the
        clothing and the hairstyle with *sakkos* or *kekruphalos*,
        influenced also by the costumes of Amazons, compare types nos.
        172–75, 396, 459, 470, 746, and 1066.

        class="smcaps">Kahil</span> 1984, no. 162; for the
        type with a hand on the hip, nos. 19, 204, 405. This pose is also
        found in the Hellenistic type of Artemis *dadophoros* (torchbearer);
        see example nos. 495–503, from Athens, Sicily, and Asia Minor,
        datable to the fourth or third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span>

        century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>); no. 264
        (statuette, perhaps from Tanagra, dating from the fourth or third
        century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>); no. 265
        (from Egnazia), and no. 389 (from Rhodes). See also <span
        class="smcaps">Winter</span> 1903, no. 5, p. 428,

        actor, at <span class="smcaps">Kahil</span> 1984,
        no. 248. For the pose, see also the statuette, possibly depicting a
        nymph, in the Museo Civico di Centuripe, inv. no. 580, and the
        statuette of Artemis with a short chiton in <span
        class="smcaps">Libertini</span> 1947, fig. 6d; see
        also a statuette of seated Artemis, wearing a short skirt with broad
        pleats, in U. Spigo, in *<span class="smcaps">La
        Sicilia greca</span>* 1989, no. 363, p. 172, dating from the second
        half of the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> For a similar
        declamatory gesture, compare the terracotta group from Centuripe,
        datable to 150–50 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>:

        the Hellenistic period: in this connection, see the terracotta,
        possibly from Egypt, in H. Kayser, *Das Pelizaeus-Museum in
        Hildesheim* (Hamburg, 1966), p. 34, fig. 47, and a group of small

        which also presents a technique and a type of polychromy that are
        quite similar to the present piece: A. D’Amicis, A. Dell’Aglio, and
