    The figure is similar in its general characteristics to [cat. 40](40), though
    the leg is not drawn as far back; in both the slight hollow and
    undulation in the fold of the drapery over the right breast is evident.
    There are two marks incised into the himation: two parallel lines on the
    proper left, and a mark like a *lambda* on the proper right. There is a
    circular hole on the lower edge of the chiton in the figure’s back.
