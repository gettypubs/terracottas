    The gilding has worn off in a number of areas; a fragment of the base is
    missing, as is the lower extremity of the vegetal element on the right side.
    The extremities of the relief have been filled. The faces of the maenads are
    worn.

    Two maenads are stretched out across a rocky base, bracketed at the ends
    by two acanthus plants with curving leaves. The figure on the right,
    with torso seen frontally and legs crossed in three-quarter view, turns
    her head toward her companion and lays an arm around her; with her right
    hand, she lifts a large tympanon, which touches the plant. She wears a
    V-neck chiton with sleeves, belted beneath her breasts, and a himation
    softly draped over her legs. The maenad on the left, slightly
    foreshortened, carries the *thyrsus* in her lap; her himation leaves her
    right shoulder uncovered. Both maenads wear their hair loosely pulled
    back; it is piled up in the middle on the left-hand figure. In the
    middle of the base is a hole for attaching the relief to a wooden
    sarcophagus; at the back of the relief, extensive traces of pink pigment
    are visible.[^1]

    The relief, made with a mold, is an openwork with hand-finished details;
    gilding was commonly used on fictile products in order to imitate more
    expensive varieties of decoration. These appliqués were produced in
    Taras in the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> in conjunction with the
    revival of lavish funerary customs, probably inspired by luxurious
    objects from Macedonia and Scythia; they were exported to a number of
    centers in Magna Graecia. Such a relief was probably fastened to the
    head of a *kline* (bed) and arranged so as to create friezes in a
    dynamic and flamboyant style. For this reason, the most common themes
    were narratives that lent themselves to a compositional continuum, such
    as the battle between Lapiths and Centaurs or that between Gryphons and
    Amazons or Arimasps, with clear iconographic and formal references to
    the limestone funerary reliefs that were popular in Taranto beginning in
    the first half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2]

    A relief in Basel, practically identical to this one, also preserves
    similar traces of pink pigment and was dated by Lullies to the third
    quarter of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3] Recently, on the basis
    of the iconography and the Dionysian themes, a parallel was proposed
    between Tarentine appliqués and a bas-relief ivory figurine found in the
    second tomb of the royal necropolis of Vergina, intended as decoration
    for a wooden funerary *kline*; this comparison revives the problem of
    economic and cultural relations between the two areas.[^4] Some themes,
    such as pairs of real and fantastic animals, or Dionysian figures partly
    outstretched on the ground with drapery wrapped around their legs, can
    be found also in the tempera-painted decorations on the marble *klinai*
    of the chamber tomb from Cassandreia, dating from the end of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^5] A late
    fourth-century terracotta from Morgantina presents in the front a
    painted panel, probably part of a garment, representing a ritual scene
    with two figures comparable to the maenads of this appliqué: a seated
    female holding a tympanon against a pink background next to a reclining
    maenad probably holding a *thyrsus*; two female dancers are placed
    symmetrically at the sides of the panels. The scene, in this case as in
    other painted panels on Sicilian busts, is connected to the cult of
    Demeter and Persephone, the tutelary deities of Sicily, protectors of
    the fecundity of nature and of women, and deeply connected with the
    chthonian sphere.[^6]

    [^1]: On Tarentine openwork reliefs, see <span class="smcaps">Lullies</span>
        1977, with bibliography; Tarentine reliefs also spread to other centers in
        southern Italy; see, for example, <span class="smcaps">Della Torre and Ciaghi</span> 1980, p. 56*,* pl. XXIII, no. 1.

        symmetrically inward at the edges, see esp. figs. 57 and 208. For
        the possible derivation from luxuries of Macedonia, Scythia, and
        Thrace, see B. S. Ridgway, “Court and Hellenistic Art,” in <span

        It has recently undergone cleaning and conservation treatment with
        pigment analysis by the Getty’s Antiquities Conservation Department.
        These treatments have revealed details of the painted scene and
        yielded more information about the bust’s pigments and the
        production technique. For painted panels on terracotta busts, see
