    The head is tilted slightly to the left. The face is oval, the forehead
    is quite broad, and the eyes are small, with the outer corners turned
    downward. The mouth is wide, with well-shaped lips and a smiling
    expression. The hair is arranged in fine locks, closely plastered to the
    cranial structure, leaving the ears uncovered and turned forward. On the
    nape of the neck, the hair is rendered conventionally with incisions in
    parallel waves, parted in the center. There is a hole above the left
    ear.

    Representations of children are attested in the votive contexts of Magna
    Graecia in the Hellenistic age. In particular, this type of head appears
    in the *favissae* of Saturo, along with fragments of statues of boys in
    a crouching position with attributes such as balls, symbolizing
    childhood. This might point to cults of a kourotrophic nature, given
    also the presence of the spring in the sacred precinct. Alternatively,
    as has been recently suggested, this type of offering could be dedicated
    to Aphrodite and Gaia, focusing on the possible multiplicity of the
    cult’s aspects in this sanctuary. In Taranto, many terracottas
    representing children have been discovered in the “Pizzone” votive
    deposit, probably connected with rites of passage.[^1] The type of the
    crouching boy, widespread in the Near East and in Greece, especially
    during the Hellenistic period,[^2] is also found in Magna Graecia,[^3]
    and in the Italic Etruscan world, in connection with the fertility of
    the fields and the cycle of life. In the votive deposits of central
    Italic sanctuaries, they are frequently associated with statues of
    children in swaddling.[^4] This head, which belonged to a statue,
    possesses characteristics that are peculiar to the heads of smiling
    children, which are generally almost entirely glabrous (smooth and
    hairless), with sunken eyes.

    This head can be dated generically through stylistic comparisons to the
    third century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For Saturo, see the terracottas representing children from
        Favissae 6 and 9 in <span class="smcaps">Settis
        and Parra</span> 2005*,* p. 440, nos. 363–65, from the second half
        of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> For Favissa 6, see <span
        class="smcaps">Monetti 2004</span>–200<span
        class="smcaps">5</span>. See also the smiling
        child’s head, tilted to one side, in *<span
        class="smcaps">Taranto</span>* 1995, pl. XXXI, no.
        4. A child’s hairless head, in the Musei Civici di Trieste (inv.
        4150), shows close affinities to the item in question. For the
        children’s terracottas from the Pizzone deposit, see <span

        (small in size and of uncertain date). Examples of terracotta
        children are documented, for instance, in Lucera, dating from
        between the beginning and the middle of the second century <span

        and pl. 25a, p. 110. Numerous variants of squatting children have
        been found in the Privati votive deposits near Castellamare di
        Stabia and from the votive deposits of the Italic temple at Paestum:
