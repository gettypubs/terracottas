    The female figure is shown frontally, standing on a curving base marked
    at the upper and lower edges by a fillet in relief and decorated by a
    pair of horizontal red lines. She places her weight on the left leg,
    while the right leg is bent. The right arm hangs straight down the
    figure’s side and is gathering folds of drapery in her hand; the left
    arm, by contrast, is raised, and the left hand, beneath which a broad
    hem of himation hangs vertically, holds up a patera. She wears a chiton
    gathered by a belt beneath the breasts, and a himation drapes down in
    broad transverse folds on the left side. The face is oval and elongated,
    and the facial features are expressed sketchily; the hair is parted over
    the forehead and gathered up. The statuette, made from a worn mold, must
    originally have been painted with bright colors.[^1]

    The relief could depict Polyboia, sister of Hyakinthos. She is a
    character of uncertain origin, generally portrayed with attributes such
    as a cornucopia, lyre, flabellum, pyxis, grape cluster, swan, rooster,
    or *phiale mesomphalos*, a bowl used in rituals.[^2]

    Such reliefs with a female figure or an ephebic figure are widespread in
    Tarentine coroplastic production, especially between the end of the
    fourth century and the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3]

    A number of myths, like that of Polyboia, entail couples involved in
    death and apotheosis; the story of her death as a virgin and ascension
    to heaven links her to the host of mythological figures whose
    existential condition is closely connected with the cycle of the
    seasons. Certain sources associate Polyboia to chthonic deities like
    Kore, with whom she shares the state of virginity and the specific
    attributes of the Underworld.[^4]

    The cult of Hyakinthos, an ancient pre-Dorian deity closely affiliated
    with Apollo, had its chief center at Amykles in Laconia. Pausanias
    described the renowned funerary monument there in Hyakinthos’s honor,
    and it was where the *hyakinthia*—among the most important festivals of
    the region—were held. The cult of Hyakinthos, which inherited a number
    of iconographic attributes from that of Apollo, enjoyed great popularity
    in the Laconian colony of Taras where, according to Polybius’s account
    of Hannibal’s taking of the city, a *taphos* *extra moenia* (a funerary
    monument placed outside the city walls) allegedly stood, though its
    location remains in doubt.[^5] Likewise, we must assume, despite the
    absence of written evidence, that the *hyakinthia* must have taken place
    in Taras with methods and rituals similar to those in Sparta. These
    rites probably also included elements typical of the Dionysian cult,
    such as the ivy wreath present in the ephebic and female examples
    referring to the divine couple. The extensive presence in Taras of this
    type of relief after the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> is documented by the material
    found in the excavations of Castelsaraceno, of the Via Peluso, and of
    Masseria del Carmine and in the votive deposits of the Via Leonida.[^6]
    It seems likely that unforeseen political developments, such as a
    request of military aid from Sparta, made it necessary to reinforce
    diplomatic relations between the two regions, in order to reaffirm their
    common origins through the revival of specific cults.[^7]

    A Tarentine findspot is nearly certain, though in the absence of
    objective data, it is not possible to assign the relief to a more
    specific cult context.[^8]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: The bright coloration is documented by better-preserved examples
        of the same typology. For the use of polychromy, see <span
        class="smcaps">Abruzzese Calabrese 1996</span>, p.
        194, no. 115.

        Villard, s.v. “Hyakinthos,” *LIMC* 5 (1990), pp. 546–50; for
        Polyboia, see A. Kossatz Deissmann, s.v. “Polyboia,” *LIMC* 7
        (1992), pp. 425–26; also <span

        relationship between Hyakinthos and Polyboia, see also <span

        pp. 25–26.

        found in Heraclea, for which see G. Pianu, *La necropoli meridionale
        di Eraclea: Le tombe di IV e III secolo a.C.* (Rome, 1990), p. 98, pl.
        XLIV, no. 3, from the late fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>; in Lucania, for which
        see M. C. D’Anisi, “Nuovi dati sui culti lucani: Un deposito votivo
        inedito da Accettura,” in <span
        class="smcaps">Nava and Osanna 2005</span>, pp.
        167–78, fig. 10; and at Capua, for which see <span
        class="smcaps">Besques 1986</span>, pl. 35d, from
        the end of the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span>

        <span class="smcaps">Piccirilli 1967</span>, pp.
        99–116, n. 100. The chthonic relevance of the deity appears to be
        confirmed as well by the attestation of nocturnal rituals in the
        context of the *hyakinthia*: see A. Stazio, “La documentazione
        archeologica in Puglia,” in *Santuari di Magna Grecia*, *AttiTaranto
        4, 1964* (Naples, 1965), pp. 153–79, pl. XI; <span
        class="smcaps">Wuilleumier 1939</span>, p. 404.

    [^5]: Pausanias (3.19.1–5) relates that on the pedestal of the statue of the
        Amyklean Apollo, there was a depiction of the apotheosis of
        Hyakinthos and Polyboia before an assembly of deities. On the
        Amyklean and Tarentine *hyakinthia* and the problem of identifying
        the funerary monument in Taranto, see <span
        class="smcaps">Abruzzese Calabrese 1987</span>,
        pp. 11–12, 23–32. See also Polybius 8.2. Lippolis’s study of this
        type of relief refuted the identification of the Polybian *taphos*
        with the votive deposits of the Contrada Carmine, based on
        topographical considerations, further calling into question whether
        these reliefs depict Polyboia and Hyakinthos: see <span
        class="smcaps">*Taranto* 1995</span>, pp. 56–58.

        91–201; <span class="smcaps">Abruzzese

        <span class="smcaps">Iacobone 1988</span>, p. 160,
        pl. 1. The chronology was proposed on the basis of a partial
        typological analysis, considering that many examples come from old
        excavations that are inadequately documented. For comparisons in
        terms of general composition and the iconographic characteristics of
        the relief, see the examples in <span

    [^8]: It should be pointed out that the votive deposit of Masseria del
        Carmine suffered a massive dispersal of the material in the years
        following its discovery.
