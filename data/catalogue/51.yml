    Votive female heads were dedicated by the hundreds as ritual offerings
    in Sicilian sanctuaries. Wearing a tall crown denoting divinity, this serene
    visage may represent the mother goddess Demeter, her daughter Kore, or a
    young bride on the eve of marriage and procreation.

    Orange in color (Munsell 2.5 yr 7/6–7/8), hard, fairly well purified, with
    reflective and calcareous inclusions; a white slip and extensive traces of
    polychromy: pink (face and neck), red (upper border of the <em>polos</em>,
    upper eyelid, and back of the neck); dark pink (central part of the
    <em>polos</em>), white and purple (lower border of the <em>polos</em>).

    The front section of the bust was made with a mold and the details of the
    facial features were defined with the use of a potter’s rib. The back
    section is not modeled and has a slightly convex wall, with a large oval
    vent hole in the center of the occiput.
  :condition: |
    A fragment of the back of the neck has been reattached; the polychromy is
    worn away, and parts of the head and neck are abraded.

    The female head wears a *polos* with a rounded base molding and
    projecting rim, decorated on the upper edge with small protruding nodes.
    The thick wavy hair is divided symmetrically into two masses and pulled
    back; on top, the hair is held by a knotted ribbon whose ends fall in
    the middle of the part. The hairstyle leaves the earlobes uncovered;
    they are perforated for the insertion of metal earrings.

    The eyes are asymmetrical and slightly sunken, and the eyelids are
    distinctly defined. The mouth is barely half-open, with a fleshy lower
    lip and an upper lip almost touching the nose, which is narrow and
    straight; the chin is rounded and full. Traces of polychromy, still
    identifiable, show that the bust was originally brightly colored. The
    lower border of the *polos* is decorated with oblique lines that are
    painted purple; in the central section, though the pigment is almost
    entirely worn away, it is possible to make out a dark pink band,
    interrupted in the center by a rosette. This decorative motif can also
    be found in other examples, in both relief and painted versions.[^1]

    This type of female bust is extensively documented in the major centers
    of Sicily, especially in the southeastern area between the fifth and
    third centuries <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in
    particular in Syracuse and Agrigento, where the earliest examples are
    documented. The most substantial group comes from the *santuario
    rupestre* (rock-cut sanctuary of Demeter) at Agrigento, but over time
    female busts also spread to Morgantina, Gela, Grammichele, Himera,
    Centuripe, Butera, Scornavacche, Selinunte, Adrano, Paternò, Akrai, and
    Lipari, with variants enriched by different ornaments and
    attributes.[^2]

    The votive bust, derived from the simpler protome, is a distinctly
    western Greek creation, generally associated with Demeter and
    Kore-Persephone, the tutelary deities of the island. It is interpreted
    as the abbreviated image, at once organic and abstract, of Persephone,
    an evocation of the *anados* of the goddess from the chthonic world.[^3]
    Recent studies reviewing the archaeological contexts and their
    associations with votive offerings have given rise to new
    interpretations, associating the bust with the *nymphe* or young bride,
    who through marriage abandons the status of *kore* and reaches sexual
    maturity. This crucial passage is well exemplified also in the
    mythological episode of the abduction by Hades, god of the Underworld,
    of Kore-Persephone, a model for human brides.[^4]

    The bust type endured for a remarkably long time, and though it
    preserved certain constant typological characteristics—in this case
    harking back to Classical models—it also gave rise to many variants.
    Some variants followed a more traditional stylistic approach, while in
    other cases the models were developed with greater freedom and
    independence.[^5] Similar typologies of busts are documented in contexts
    throughout Magna Graecia, such as, for example, Fratte di Salerno, where
    the production documents stylistic links with Syracusan terracottas but
    also with the production of Campania and Locri; the latter was also
    closely tied to Syracuse politically and culturally, as far back as the
    Deinomenid era.[^6] The bust type later spread through the
    central-Italic area, with a number of different typological and
    iconographic variations, but also taking on a distinct function: it was
    less closely tied to the chthonic sphere and more often acted as an
    abbreviated portrayal of the offerer.[^7]

    The busts have for some time been datable to the final decades of the
    fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in part
    due to stylistic affinities with the coinage of contemporary Syracusan
    master die-engravers; they have been dated as late as the second half of
    the fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in
    the period of Classical revival that corresponds to a general rebirth of
    the Greek centers in Sicily, led by the tyrant Timoleon. This age,
    following the crisis of the first half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, has generally been
    characterized as a return to classically inspired formal and
    iconographic motifs. More recent studies, however, including those
    devoted to the coroplastic material of Scornavacche (near Ragusa), have
    noted the continuous utilization of the female bust of Classical origin,
    from the period of Dionysius up to that of Timoleon. This phenomenon is
    attributable primarily to the workshops of Syracuse, which, just at the
    beginning of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, held to the Classical style,
    in part as a matter of cultural identity.[^8]

    The persistence over time of standardized typologies, due to
    conservatism in artistic conceptions and the reutilization of older
    molds, resulted in the production of numerous generations of closely
    similar examples, which has made a detailed and accurate chronology
    problematic. Furthermore, the Getty bust echoes certain distinctive
    features of the Agrigentine busts of the second half of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, especially in
    the rendering of Classical-style facial features, such as the full chin,
    the small mouth with a prominent upper lip, and the triangular forehead,
    as well as in the solid articulation of the facial planes and in the
    general sobriety of the expression. These characteristics are also found
    in a group of busts from Morgantina, together with the molding at the
    upper edge and ears pierced for metal earrings.[^9] The freehand
    hairstyle, with lively, puffy locks of hair, closely corresponds to the
    emerging artistic tendencies of the Early Hellenistic period; the latter
    is also found in a number of Syracusan busts.[^10]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For the painted busts, see, for instance, examples in Morgantina
        that can have the *polos* with a pink flower and the unmolded bust

        scenes: <span class="smcaps">Bell 1981</span>, pp.

        the busts present a polysemic character and take on a particular
        meaning only within the “system” of the votive offerings made in a
        specific context; but a primary meaning related to marriage as a
        woman’s sexual and existential completion seems to be prevalent.
