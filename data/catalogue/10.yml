    The face is set upon a strong neck marked by two Venus rings. The
    features are full in form, with asymmetrical eyes and thick eyelids
    folded downward at the outer corners. The right superciliary arch is
    closer to and parallel with the upper eyelid. The mouth, with a fleshy
    lower lip, is close to the straight, tapering nose with its flattened
    ridge; the chin is rounded with a dimple where it joins the mouth, and
    the jaw is full. The hair, parted in the middle, and evident on the nape
    of the neck as well, is depicted by means of deep, sharp incisions,
    possibly executed with a comb-like tool, and it is held back in the
    middle of the forehead by a diadem. The hair is combed in thick parallel
    waves toward the back of the neck and gathered in a roll behind the
    neck, leaving the earlobes uncovered. The ears are pierced for the
    insertion of earrings, probably of metal.[^1]

    The type is reminiscent of the votive busts widespread in southeastern
    Sicily and Magna Graecia in the fifth and the second half of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and is
    characterized by elements that can still be assigned to the Classical
    period. The piece, which retains a certain schematic rigidity
    accentuated in part by the frontal composition, displays a stereotypical
    depiction of facial features that is common in Sicilian bust types
    connected to the Demeter cult.[^2] Certain distinctive elements, such as
    the linearity of the hairstyle and the roll of hair behind the neck, can
    also be found in a number of female types from Centuripe and
    Morgantina.[^3] The detail of the Venus rings is found also in a number
    of Tarentine heads datable to the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, such as a marble head from
    Taranto now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, which is
    close to the Getty bust in the compactness of its forms and the
    downward-turning corners of the eyes with close-set eyebrows. Based on
    its style, the Getty head can be dated to the middle of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^4]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: The practice of drilling holes through the earlobes for the
        insertion of metal earrings was common in the workshops of Magna
        Graecia and Sicily; in this connection, see cat. 51.

        class="smcaps">Kilmer</span> 1977, pp. 122–23,
        159–76. n. 52. The most recent studies on this topic have discussed
        the connection of votive female busts to the Demeter and
        Kore-Persephone cult; underlining how the possible association of a
        votive with a specific god or goddess can only be affirmed by study
        of the entire system of dedications. For their diffusion in Magna
        Graecia and Central Italy, see <span

        powerful neck and a distinct joint between jaw and neck; for
        Morgantina, see <span class="smcaps">Bell</span>
        1981, no. 112, pl. 31, possibly around 300 <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> The hairstyle is also
        found in many male and female heads of the Severe style, see <span
        class="smcaps">Ridgway</span> 1970, pp. 138–39,
        fig. 179. For the rolled hairstyle, see also cat. 7. In the
        sculpture from Metaponto, one finds the same distinctive rendering
        of the hair as thin strands in dense, parallel waves: P. Orlandini,

        Grecs et l’Occident:* *Actes du Colloque de la Villa “Kérylos,”
