    The statuette depicts a young female musician who, with a cadenced step,
    walks toward the viewer’s right. With her right hand, she plucks an
    instrument carried on her left shoulder; given its small size, the
    instrument can be identified as a “cradle kithara.” Her weight is on her
    right leg, which steps forward, while her left leg is slightly bent and
    crosses behind her. Her torso is flexed strongly backward, as is her
    head, which also turns to the proper right in a pose of ecstasy. The
    face is round, the cheeks are full, and her expression is smiling; her
    tresses, parted into two bands on her forehead, are drawn back onto the
    nape of her neck in a broad cluster of hair, falling in compact locks
    onto her shoulders.[^1] Following her sinuous movement, her long,
    high-waisted chiton clings to her body; emphasizing her prominent
    breasts and buttocks, the garment falls in broad, soft folds. The base
    is an irregularly shaped oval, on the left side of which is a vent hole.

    The figure is characterized by a pronounced flexing of the torso and by
    a dynamic rhythm that develops progressively from the raised left heel
    toward the top of the figure. This sort of weighting is found also in
    many figures of females dancers discovered among the funerary deposits
    of the Early Hellenistic period from Magna Graecia and Sicily, where
    dance and music played a prominent role in Dionysian cult contexts as
    well in rites of passage from childhood to adolescence.[^2]

    Dancers and female musicians with lyres and kitharas are particularly
    well represented in the funerary deposits of Taranto, Lipari, and
    Centuripe, generally dating from the third century or second century
    <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3] Such figures are
    presented in poses similar to that of the Getty’s dancer, that is,
    characterized by sinuous rhythms and by a new spatial construction of
    the figure developed in coeval statuary of the Early Hellenistic
    period.[^4] The presence of music in the funerary context is well
    documented by finds of these instruments in tomb contexts in Athens and
    in funerary deposits in Locri, Taranto, and Paestum in Magna
    Graecia.[^5] Such dancer and musician typologies are also well attested
    in the Hellenistic period at Priene, Myrina, Pergamon, and Cyrene, where
    they were produced up until the first century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>; the latter cities were
    involved in an especially intense exchange of motifs and iconographies
    with Magna Graecia in which, at least in the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, Taranto seems to have played
    an especially active role.[^6]

    The presence of the cradle kithara—a typically female instrument due to
    its small size and its high-pitched sound—in combination with the
    theatrical type of chiton—high-belted, light, with short sleeves, which
    in other typologies may be accompanied by a himation wrapped around the
    arms or on the hips—can be traced to the iconography of the Muse, which
    seems to have been the inspiration for this figure.[^7] In gems as well
    as terracottas, it is possible to find a number of comparisons for the
    Muse playing an instrument, though the schemes tend to be different: in
    fact, it is more common to see the instrument carried on the torso or to
    one side, rather than over the shoulder. Sometimes the kithara is set on
    a small pillar, or the figure might be resting a foot on a rocky rise,
    or playing in a seated position.[^8] The scheme of this statue, with the
    kithara set on the left shoulder—a position that accentuates the arched
    back and markedly emphasizes the pelvis, creating an almost grotesque
    deformation of the figure—is therefore unusual.[^9]

    In the absence of reliable information on the object’s findspot, it is
    difficult to identify the figure with any precision. Stylistically, it
    is reminiscent of a number of examples from Centuripe datable to between
    the end of the third century and the beginning of the second century
    <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^10]

        221. The position of the figure with torso bent backward is also
        comparable to that of a female figure incised in a ring, in G. M. A.
        Richter, *The Metropolitan Museum of Art*: *Handbook of the Greek
        Collection* (New York, 1973), fig. 126, and to a figure with chiton,
        head turned to the left, and with a lyre in the left hand, dating
        from the fourth century <span

        figure of a dancing maenad); also see the cameo from the Roman era
        in *<span class="smcaps">La musique et la
        danse* 1996</span>, no. 112.

    [^9]: A Muse in a more emphatic pose can be seen in a gem dating from
        the last third of the first century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> with a figure in profile
        playing the kithara; this figure shares with the current statuette
        the torso flexing backward, the tilted head, and the left leg drawn
        back, but the instrument is held in front. See J. Lancha, s.v.
        “Mousa/Mousae,” *LIMC* 7, suppl. (1994), p. 1021, no. 63.

    [^10]: The type seems also to include elements of both caricature and
        realism that might have reflected tastes of Alexandrian inspiration
        attested in Sicily and Magna Graecia. The grotesque deformations
        seem to be reminiscent as well of the steatopygic female figures of
        Alexandrian inspiration: see R. Paribeni, “Ariccia: Rilievo con
        scene egizie,” *NSc* (1919), pp. 106–12; E. van’t Dack, “Les
        relations entre l’Egypte ptolemaïque et l’Italie,” in E. van’t Dack,

        World: Proceedings of the International Colloquium, Leuven, 24–26
        May 1982* (Leuven, 1983), pp. 383–406.
