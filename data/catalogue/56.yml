    Light beige in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/3), purified, compact and smooth,
    with numerous small, reflective inclusions; a layer of white slip; traces
    of light blue and pink pigments on the drapery, red pigment on the hair,
    the feet, and the base; and pink color for the complexion. Made with two
    bivalve molds, the head was applied to the body before firing; there is a
    large circular vent hole in the back.

    This half-draped figure has the left leg bent to rest the left foot on a
    rock; the torso is leaning to the left and the head is turned toward the
    right. A himation is rolled up on the hips and knotted in front,
    covering the legs but leaving the groin and the upper body uncovered.
    The face is oval, the hair is in wavy locks divided into two bands that
    are gathered on the nape of the neck in a low chignon; the feet are shod
    in sandals.

    This figure adopts the Hellenistic type of the nymph with a bare torso
    and foot resting on a rocky elevation. This type, quite widespread in
    Hellenistic statuary, is an amalgamation of various depictions of
    Aphrodite: the cloak that softly drapes the lower half of the body
    refers to Aphrodite Anadyomene; the elongated torso is derived from the
    Aphrodite of Arles; and the general tone of the modeling in the
    hairstyle and the lean, oval face with its nuanced surfaces is
    Praxitelean.[^1] In its numerous variants this type can be found in
    various centers throughout the Mediterranean,[^2] and it gained
    considerable popularity in Magna Graecia and especially in Taranto,
    where it was reused in the local workshops.[^3] It is found in Sicily as
    well, especially in Centuripe, where it developed in many variants with
    changes in the attributes or the positions of the arms and head,
    attesting—especially in the Hellenistic period—to the circulation and
    affinity of Apulian iconographic types among various centers in Sicily,
    though it is essential to evaluate the specific contexts in order to
    explain iconography and functions of this type of statuette. Centuripe,
    in particular, was an important center for the reception and elaboration
    of outside ideas. This process has yet to be grasped in all its
    complexity, but in the Early Hellenistic period, the town clearly had
    direct contact with the art of Magna Graecia, Greece, and Macedonia: a
    dense web of political relationships, beginning especially in the age of
    Agathocles, placed Sicily within the larger context of the Hellenistic
    Mediterranean.[^4] The iconography of the semi-nude woman with her foot
    resting on a rock was also adopted for the portrayal of female musicians
    and Nikai, as these were related to marriage rituals and the passage in
    status from *kore* to *nymphe*.[^5]
