  :fabric: |
    Pinkish yellow color (Munsell 7.5 yr 6/8), friable and purified, with
    extensive traces of polychromy over a thick layer of white slip: red
    ocher (hair and attachments of the wings), calcite (drapery), and Egyptian
    blue (himation). The pinkish pigment on areas of the chest and pelvis has
    been identified as shell white, likely a modern pigment applied to cover
    damaged areas. The statuette was made from two molds, for the front and
    back; the legs are solid. The head, arms, legs, and wings were applied
    before firing.
  :condition: |
    Missing arms and lower legs. Surfaces are abraded, and the polychromy is
    faded at many points.
  :provenance: |
    * 1969, Leo Mildenburg (Zurich, Switzerland);
    * 1971, Royal Athena Galleries (New York, New York), sold to the J. Paul
      Getty Museum, 1971.

  :description: |2

    The young nude Eros is standing with his weight on the left leg and the
    right leg drawn slightly back, determining the flexed pose of the torso.
    A roll of fabric is draped around the hips, dangling over his thighs,
    with two long ends arranged on either side at the rear. The head is
    turned slightly to the left; the hair is parted over the forehead and,
    forming a bow at the top, dangles softly in puffy locks on either side
    of the neck. The face is oval, with pronounced cheekbones; the mouth is
    small; the facial features are nuanced. The left arm was raised, and the
    wings (now missing) must have been spread.

    This youthful winged Eros with drapery rolled below his hips harks back
    to an iconography widely documented in Hellenistic coroplastic art.[^1]
    It finds points of contact with other examples, especially those from
    Taranto and Centuripe that can be dated to the third quarter of the
    second century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span> for the
    most part belonging to funerary deposits of children.[^2] The elongated
    torso with its soft forms echoes the more stereotypical creations of the
    Praxitelean tradition and resembles the stylistic Erotes that were
    mass-produced in Myrina, among other places. In the rendering of these
    figures, we see the same technical methods that characterize the figures
    of the second century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>:
    a generally summary modeling accompanied by a fairly rough coloring and
    inadequate firing. The expressive rendering of the figure is usually
    focused on the movement of the arms.[^3]

    #### Appendix

    The statuette’s pigments were examined using PLM. A sample of blue from
    the rope of drapery at the front of the figure was identified as
    Egyptian blue. The white on the drapery was identified as containing
    calcite, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed this pigment as calcite.
    The dark red on the hair was identified as red ocher. The pinkish-gray
    paint seen on many areas of the chest and at the pelvis was identified
    as possibly a shell white, used in ancient times but much more commonly
    in inexpensive modern paints. It had a very different appearance under
    PLM than the original white pigment. UV-visible fluorescence examination
    shows the overpainted areas clearly. Samples were taken from both the
    lower half of the figure and from the head. It is assumed that the piece
    is whole with some damage having occurred in the past. The legs were
    most probably broken off and reattached, as was the rope of the drapery.
    The chest suffered some damage and was repaired and painted over with
    modern pigments. An arm had probably been reattached to the proper left
    side of the figure at some point, as adhesive residue is found there.
    That arm is now missing, as is the right arm.
