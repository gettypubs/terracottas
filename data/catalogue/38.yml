  :fabric: >
    Light orange in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/4), friable, fairly well purified
    with very small reflective particles; white slip or ground layer is in
    color, tending toward a light greenish yellow on the surface.
    Polychromy: organic pink (vertical band along the left side of the chiton),
    iron-based red pigment (hair, sandals, and traces within the lips), and
    possible black details (chiton and himation).
  :condition: >
    Broken and repaired with some terracotta abrasions. There is significant
    loss of the white ground and polychromy, and what remains is covered by
    burial accretions and modern overpaint.
  :provenance: >
    1985, Galerie Hydra (Geneva, Switzerland), sold to the J. Paul Getty
    Museum, 1985.

    The standing female figure in a frontal position has a bent left leg,
    pushed slightly forward; her arms are bent at the elbows and her hands
    are raised in a gesture of lamentation; the fingers are spread wide and
    are clearly shaped, with an indication of fingernails. The head is
    tilted slightly to one side and turned toward the left; the face is oval
    and lean, the chin is sharp, the forehead is high, the eyebrows are
    furrowed, the nose is accentuated; the pupils and the irises are etched,
    and the eyelids are clearly marked; the mouth, with its lower lip
    projecting more than the upper, is stretched in an expression of
    sadness.

    The figure wears a chiton adorned by a vertical pink band on the proper
    left side and a himation with a pointed border worn as a shawl that
    drapes over the bust, revealing the chiton beneath on either side; the
    chiton is defined by a circular hem in the front and by broad pleats
    rendered sketchily in three dimensions. This type of costume is also
    found on figures painted on Apulian vases.[^1] An “H” sign is incised
    into the himation.

        Canosan vases and the large statues, see Jeammet 2003a, pp. 271–75.
