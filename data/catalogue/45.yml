    The little nude, winged Eros is shown seated. The left arm holds a small lyre pressed against the abdomen; the right hand holds a *plektron*. The bright, lively polychromy is spread over a layer of white slip.[^1] Two faint red straps cross over the chest; the forms of the body are plump, with a prominent belly and a clearly marked navel, chubby legs, and short, spread wings. The figure’s back is flat. The face is round with delicate facial features, the eyes are slightly sunken, and the mouth is small and fleshy. The hair forms a curly mass over the forehead.
