    Pinkish in color (Munsell 5 yr 7/4); in the back, the clay is a lighter
    hue (Munsell 5 yr 8/2), with a friable, porous consistency. The surface
    is coated with a layer of greenish diluted clay and a layer of whitish
    slip (calcite?). Polychromy: light blue (beard), pink (neck, face, lips),
    reddish brown (curls of hair). The added pigments would have been applied
    after the firing process.
  :condition: >
    The head is broken off on a line with the neck; several curls from the
    beard and hair are missing; the polychromy is worn away in many places.
    There are traces of black (from combustion?) on the left cheek and on the
    curls. The surface is heavily encrusted with clay/dirt and clay/carbonate
    mixture. There are numerous areas of pigment loss and ground loss. Pigment
    areas are powdery and fragile, adhering only loosely to the surface.

  :description: |2
    The male head is characterized by a voluminous beard and a thick
    hairstyle that covers the entire cranium. Both beard and hair consist of
    hand-worked thick, spiraling curls that were applied before firing. The
    face is squared off; the forehead is low and wreathed by a
    regularly-shaped border of hair; the cheekbones are high, and the
    eyebrows straight. The almond-shaped eyes are defined by deep incisions
    made while the clay was still damp; the iris is rendered through a
    shallower incised line, and the eyelids are indicated by a light
    swelling. The nose is straight and narrow, the lips are fleshy, barely
    open, and not joined at the corners; the upper lip is more thoroughly
    modeled and the lower lip is almost straight. The transition from the
    smooth cheeks to the curls of the beard is rendered with finely incised
    lines, and the undulating shape of the moustache is formed by an
    overlaid layer of clay with oblique lines cut into it.

    The facial features are inscribed in the face with a rigid linearity
    and, in its original appearance, the vibrant intensity and the abstract
    quality of the applied pigments would have been meant to express the
    dramatic epiphany of the god. As the discontinuous break on a line with
    the neck indicates, the head belonged to a larger figure, probably a
    statue.

    This very peculiar head comes from Morgantina, a settlement in central
    Sicily. Its archaeological context was confirmed by the discovery of
    terracotta statue fragments in the area of the *Thesmophorion* sanctuary
    at San Francesco Bisconti in Morgantina, site of the women’s cult of
    Demeter. Among the fragments of drapery and limbs, probably detached
    from large-scale sculptures, a number of hand-shaped spiral curls were
    found that are identical to those on this head in terms of dimensions,
    style, color, and fabric.[^1]

    The extramural sanctuary of San Francesco Bisconti, the most important
    in Morgantina dedicated to the goddesses Demeter and Persephone, was
    continuously occupied over a long period of time between the sixth and
    third centuries <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. It
    comprises a complex of cultic *sacella* and *naiskoi* built on
    artificial terraces cut into the hillside.[^2] This sanctuary is the
    presumed context for a life-size statue of Demeter in marble and
    limestone, which is exhibited in the Museo Archeologico di Morgantina in
    Aidone, as well as two sets of marble acroliths—heads, hands, and
    feet—belonging to seated cult statues of Demeter and Persephone.[^3] In
    interpreting the head’s iconography, it is important to consider that it
    had appeared on the antiquities market together with a terracotta female
    head wearing a *polos*. The female head is of similar dimensions and
    displays an identical technical and stylistic rendering of the facial
    features: voluminous masses of hair, incised eyes, straight nose, and a
    mouth defined by an undulating upper lip and downturned outer corners.
    These characteristics make its association with this bearded head almost
    certain. Considered together, the presumed findspot in the
    *Thesmophorion* sanctuary and the possible connection with the image of
    a female deity would allow us to identify the pair as Hades and
    Persephone, central figures of ancient Sicilian worship.[^4]

    Both the articulation of the sanctuary architecture and the types and
    peculiar placement of votive offerings in various areas clearly allude
    to the cult of Persephone and her mother Demeter, which was closely tied
    to agricultural fertility, female fecundity, and women’s roles as brides
    and mothers. In this context, the abduction and rape of Kore-Persephone,
    her marriage to Hades, and her cyclical return to earth (the *kathados*
    and *anados*) on which the flourishing of nature depends, were
    understood by the worshipers as the model of mortal marriage, closely
    intertwined with life and death, and with female and natural bounty.[^5]
    In particular, Kore’s abduction was marked as a metaphor for the crucial
    and violent passage between maidenhood and a woman’s new status as a
    bride, a moment particularly celebrated within the ancient civic
    community.[^6]

    The god of the Underworld, like male figures generally, is infrequently
    represented in the coroplastic production of Sicily, but occurs somewhat
    more regularly in Morgantina. From sanctuary deposits at the site, Hades
    has been identified in a small group of large-dimension statuettes ,
    representing a young, beardless male standing figure wrapped in a
    himation that covers the legs, datable to the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>. In some examples, his arm is
    bent forward in a sacrificial gesture; he wears the characteristic
    wreath of the bridegroom; in one case, he holds a turquoise snake, a
    typically chthonic attribute. According to Bell, the young man
    identified as Hades is represented as beardless in his role of
    bridegroom, on the occasion of his wedding with Persephone.[^7]

    Hades and Persephone are also the main characters in scenes depicted on
    the *pinakes* dedicated as *anathemata* in the Persephoneion at
    Mannella, near Locri, mainly datable to 490–450 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>. They depict the various
    episodes of the myth and the rituals celebrated in honor of the goddess
    in connection with the passage from childhood to adulthood, and in
    particular from the status of *kore* to that of *nymphe*. In the
    *pinakes*, the god plays the dual role of Kore’s abductor and
    Persephone’s bridegroom in the Underworld. In the first subject, one of
    the most frequently represented among the different iconographic
    variants, Hades is identified with certainty only as an adult with full
    beard and curly or wavy hair. The beardless young abductor depicted in
    some *pinakes*, by contrast, has been extensively discussed and is
    interpreted by some as a mere mortal: in this case, the scene could be a
    symbolic representation of a ritual celebration of nuptials inspired by
    the mythological event.[^8]

    In the *pinakes* belonging to the group of the “consenting rape,” Hades
    and Persephone are represented as a divine pair sitting calmly in a
    quadriga, Persephone having already achieved her status as a bride;
    there is no allusion to the violence of the act.[^9] The divine pair is
    also extensively depicted in the *pinakes* of the *anakalypteria*
    (unveiling) group, which shows Hades and Persephone, enthroned as Queen
    of the Underworld, in a royal, solemn attitude, like two simulacra,
    receiving offerings from other deities. In such images, Hades is shown
    wrapped in a himation that covers the lower part of his body; he may
    hold any of a variety of attributes (a pomegranate, a scepter, a phiale,
    wheat ears, or a goose). He wears a long beard and moustache, and his
    hair is either tied with a ribbon, wreathed with leaves or flowers, or
    adorned with a diadem. In some examples (type 8/10), the presence of a
    door may recall, as a visual synecdoche, the *thalamos* (bridal
    chamber), the realm, or a cultic place.[^10]

    Hades’ iconography is generally quite problematic and can entail
    interpretive ambiguities. Certain distinctive elements, nevertheless,
    rather than physiognomic features per se, can support his
    identification: an enthroned position next to a *paredra* (consort); the
    half-face representation; visual allusions to the realm of the
    Underworld; or the presence of a scepter and, in some cases, a
    cornucopia, a snake, or Cerberus.[^11] There is another remarkable group
    of *pinakes*, also from the area of the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore in
    Francavilla di Sicilia, a center that in the fifth century BC was under
    the political influence of Syracuse. In this group—derived from Locrian
    prototypes, as is evident from various stylistic and iconographic
    aspects—the abduction scene recurs with the representation of Hades and
    Persephone as a divine couple on a quadriga in the schema of the
    consenting rape, or enthroned in their roles as sovereigns of the
    Underworld (*theogamiai* group), alone or with other deities. In the
    *epiphaniai* group, the two heads are depicted in silhouette, detached
    from any mythological description in order to underscore the essentially
    abstract and solemn values of the image.^.^[^12] In the Francavilla
    *pinakes*, Hades displays the usual features but also more peculiar
    details alluding to those *epikleses* (invocations) that better help to
    connote the god: for example, the wreath or garland, probably of roses,
    alludes to Zeus Katachthonios (“Underworld Zeus”), who is also
    assimilated with Hades in his role as sovereign of the Underworld; or to
    Zeus Meilichios (“kindly” or “honeyed” Zeus), a beneficent figure who
    was associated with rites of expiation and purification. In some
    *pinakes*, Hades is also compared to Zeus Eleutherios (“Deliverer”) by
    holding an eagle-headed scepter and wearing a garland of oak leaves. The
    cult of Zeus Eleutherios flourished particularly in Syracuse after the
    fall of Thrasybulus in 466 BC and the subsequent institution of
    democratic government.[^13]

    In Attic vases and especially in Apulian red-figure vases of the fourth
    century BC, the Underworld couple is extensively depicted seated or
    standing inside a *naiskos* surrounded by various mythological figures,
    in lively scenes characterized by the decorative exuberance peculiar to
    South Italian pottery. In a volute krater from Canosa datable to 320 BC,
    for example, Hades demonstrates his majesty through an eagle-headed
    scepter and sumptuous garments while Persephone wearing a diadem and
    veil stands before her bridegroom holding a four-headed torch; a volute
    krater by the White Saccos Painter is characterized by a reprisal of the
    schema of the two enthroned deities that is seen in the *pinakes*.[^14]
    This iconographic model of the couple, repeatedly illustrated on the
    *pinakes* of Locri and Francavilla, shows them in their chthonic aspect
    but also in a positive role as givers of fertility, possibly enthroned
    in a solemn, epiphanic vision. After more than a century, this model was
    reproduced again in the Getty’s head of Hades connected to the near twin
    head of Persephone, both of which were probably installed within a
    *sacellum* in the *Thesmophorion* of Morgantina.[^15] Another
    iconographic typology, which was already codified in the fifth century
    BC in specific contexts, centered on the figure of Persephone; it
    recurred especially in the area of Syracuse, to which both Francavilla
    and Locri were connected politically and culturally.[^16]

    This interpretation is necessarily hypothetical, given the paucity of
    male cult sculptures recovered from sanctuaries dedicated to Demeter and
    Persephone and the absence of a precise archaeological context.[^17]
    Nevertheless, analysis of the physiognomic and formal elements allow the
    placement of this head in a context influenced by a number of works of
    post-Phidian derivation, characterized in some cases by the coloristic
    effects of the red hair and blue beard. In the fourth century BC, this
    virile type, defined by the dense mass of hair and voluminous beard, was
    adopted for a diverse array of deities, such as Dionysos, Hades, and
    Zeus, evidencing the iconographic contamination that was quite common in
    the Hellenistic period. In this instance, however, further identifying
    elements are lacking.

    In the rare representations of Hades, the Underworld god often shares
    traits with Zeus, especially when Zeus takes on chthonic connotations
    linked with the sphere of natural fertility, as with Zeus Meilichios or
    Zeus Katachthonios. These traits, as noted above, are assimilated to
    Hades in the *pinakes* of Locri and Francavilla.[^18] In sculpture, a
    statue of Zeus Katachthonios datable between 440 and 430 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> is known to have been made by
    Agorakritos, and it has been recognized in the so-called Dresden Zeus,
    which is characterized by distinctively intense chiaroscuro tones,
    especially notable in the hair and beard.[^19]

    A number of physiognomic details—the ringlets of the beard, the
    treatment of the hair under the lower lip, the accentuated cheekbones,
    and the mustache—place the Getty’s head within an iconographic tradition
    that runs from the archetype of the Phidian colossus in the Temple of
    Zeus at Olympia; continuing through the head of Zeus from Cyrene, also
    traceable to the typology of the Dresden Zeus; and finally recognizable
    in the middle-Italic and Etruscan contexts in a number of terracotta
    bearded heads, such as the one in the architectural decoration of the
    temple at Lo Scasato at Falerii, in Faliscan territory, dated to the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> It
    signals the persistence of the Phidian artistic model, which enduringly
    influenced generations of artists.[^20]

    In the fourth century as well, in two coinage series of Syracuse—datable
    to after 348 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, during
    the Timoleontic period, and imitated in the issues of other Sicilian
    towns—the profile head of Zeus Eleutherios can be seen, with a long
    beard and curly hair held back by small olive branches. In particular,
    one of the series was thought to have been derived from the staters of
    Elis-Olympia, minted for the first time after 421 <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> and influenced by the work of
    Phidias, which continued to evolve typologically until the middle of the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^21]
    Morgantina, during its war against the Romans between 213 and 211 BC,
    also produced a silver litra characterized by the head of Zeus
    Eleutherios; on the reverse is the legend <span
    class="smcaps">Sikeliotan</span>, interpretable as an
    expression of the town’s freedom and independence in this critical
    period.[^22]

    It is difficult to connect the Getty’s head closely with the Syracusan
    coins of the second half of the fourth century because the images on the
    coins rarely find exact iconographic correspondences in other media;
    nevertheless, stylistically the head can be considered as a local
    “baroque” or stereotyped interpretation of a noble typology elaborated
    within the classical Phidian tradition, which characterizes the artistic
    production of Sicily in this period. In this sense, the reprisal of
    classical motifs during the age of Timoleon in a production associated
    with the religious sphere was intended to express, in a conservative and
    recognizable language, the bond to an artistic model that still felt
    alive and distinguished, in order to represent religious and political
    ideals.

    Given the lack of comparable male terracotta sculptures from
    archaeological contexts, it is difficult to bracket the chronology of
    the piece. Some features, such as the mouth shape and the general facial
    structure, seem to be related stylistically to the late fifth century
    BC, but the possibility that these elements represented a stylistic
    heritage from the second half of the fourth century, drawn from an
    earlier prototype, a period when Syracusan models dominated the artistic
    production of Morgantina, cannot be ruled out.[^23]

    The most distinctive feature in the definition of the face—the incised
    line in the rendering of the eyes—is found in Magna Graecia and Sicily
    in a number of fictile heads that date from the sixth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> Examples include a head,
    probably of a sphinx, from Agrigento (550–530 <span
    class="smcaps">BC)</span>; a head from Caulonia (late
    sixth century) now in the Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria; a large
    head of a female deity from Medma (late sixth to early fifth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC)</span>; and a number of
    protomes from Locri, where the delineation of the eyes through deep
    incision appears to have been fairly common.[^24] The same detail, which
    may point to bronze prototypes, is also found in the Etruscan milieu. A
    female head from the Campetti votive deposit at Veii, not far removed
    from this piece in the treatment of the lips, eyebrows, and nose, finds
    parallels in typologies dating from the Classical period, and is
    probably assignable to the middle of the fifth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> The possibility that the
    eyes and the incisions in this piece were refined with color in order to
    give the face greater expressive intensity cannot be excluded.[^25] On
    the other hand, it seems improbable that lashes in bronze or any other
    material were inserted into the incision. This practice was more common
    on marble statues (such as the female head from the sanctuary of Hera
    Lacinia in Crotone and a marble head from Metaponto), though metal
    ornaments such as earrings did often decorate terracotta heads and
    votive busts.[^26]

    The polychromy, in particular the blue beard, clearly had symbolic
    meaning; blue was emblematic of eternity, due to its resemblance to the
    color of the sky, as well as being indicative of power and worth.[^27]
    From the Homeric age and according to a convention deriving from Egypt
    and Middle Eastern traditions, the color blue particularly connoted the
    gods and was used in literature for its evocative and poetic meanings,
    especially in relation to Poseidon, Dionysos, and Hades. In fact, blue
    is only used for the representation of mortals when the character is
    already dead or transfiguring through the intervention of a god.[^28] In
    sculpture, the most famous example is the “blue-bearded” monster from
    the pedimental group of the Old Athena Temple in Athens, datable to
    575–550 BC; here, too, the bright color could be a figurative
    translation of a literary and poetic convention.[^29]

    #### Appendix

    This head was subjected to the following analyses: energy dispersive XRF
    of pigments and ground; microscopic and microchemical analysis of the
    blue pigment; infrared analysis of the rose color; determination of the
    terracotta’s firing temperature by means of thermomechanical and
    thermoluminescence analysis. The results confirmed the authenticity of
    the piece and the dating proposed here.

    Results: Pigment is Egyptian blue. The reddish-brown color contains an
    iron oxide pigment (ocher); a high lead content also suggests the
    presence of lead white. The firing temperature of the terracotta was
    approximately 785°C. The pigments found on the head are consistent with
    those used at the proposed date of origin.

        perfectly to gaps in the beard and hair of the head in a 2012
        examination conducted by the Getty’s Antiquities Conservation
        Department, which confirmed their findspot in the San Francesco
        Bisconti sanctuary. The Head of Hades was approved for deaccession
        in 2012.

        few large-scale terracotta sculptures published are female; see also
        idem., pp. 232–33 for male figurines from Sicilian sanctuaries. One
        should also mention the discovery of fragments of terracotta
        statues, also male, that were architectural decorative elements of
        cultic buildings from the site of Monte Altesina, north of Enna;
        among them was found the curl of a female protome of the second half
        of the fourth–beginning of the third century BC, similar to those of
        our head: see C. Bonanno, “Frammenti di terrecotte architettoniche

        Kore at Corinth, the majority of large-scale terracotta sculptures,
        Bookidis believes, represent young male votaries “more likely than
        cult figures,” but the author also remarks that this preponderance
        is puzzling if we consider that the majority of the figurines are
        female and “the absence of parallels for this type of material among
        the excavated sites and the existing sources” should be a warning:
