  :description: |2
    The head, which must have belonged to a bust or statue, is set on a
    massive neck marked by a single “Venus ring.” The face is broad, with a
    rounded chin and full cheeks, almond-shaped eyes with heavy eyelids,
    well-defined eyebrows, a straight nose, and a slightly open mouth with
    fleshy lips and a more prominent lower lip. The hair is drawn up under a
    *sakkos* (hair covering) with a banded edge and emerges on either side
    of the face in thick, wavy locks that bulge outward, leaving the
    earlobes visible. The figure is probably dressed in a chiton fastened at
    the shoulder by a round button. On the top of the head, corresponding to
    the button of the *sakkos*, we can see a hole marked by radial
    incisions.

    This type is well attested in Tarentine coroplastic art and can be dated
    between the end of the fifth and the first half of the fourth century
    BC<span class="smcaps">.</span>[^1] The traits it
    displays—a big face with a rounded jaw, small nose, mouth with sinuous
    lips, all largely derived from Attic Classical prototypes—are also found
    in the local sculptural tradition.[^2] Even the type of hairstyle is
    influenced by echoes of the post-Phidian school, which influenced not
    only the plastic arts but also a number of coin types in Magna Graecia,
    such as the female head found on staters from Terina after 420 BC<span
    class="smcaps">.</span>[^3]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: There are some unpublished comparisons from *favissa* 6 of Saturo
        (crate 1290), in particular a statue head with a *sakkos* featuring
        the same radial detail indicating the folds around the button on top
        of the head covering; see also a piece in <span
        class="smcaps">Herdejürger 1982</span>, p. 65, no.
        120 (dated 375–350 <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>); <span
        class="smcaps">Iacobone 1988</span>, pl. 128 d*,*
        p. 135, dating from the middle of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> Further, a small female
        bust is reminiscent of the head in terms of hairstyle and heavy
        facial features: <span class="smcaps">Letta</span>
        1971*,* pl. XV, no. 1, p. 93–95; see also <span
        class="smcaps">Higgins 1954</span>, pl. 175 (late
        fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>);
        <span class="smcaps">Fischer-Hansen 1992</span>,
        no. 54, p. 84, as the beginning of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> For the type of chiton
        closed by “buttons,” see <span
        class="smcaps">D’Ercole 1990</span>, p. 95, pl.
        33b.

        and fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>,
        see the previous entry and <span
        class="smcaps">Belli Pasqua 1995</span>, pp. 5–6;
        and for a female marble head of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC,</span> pp. 70–71. This female
        type could be reminiscent of Phidian models, such as the head of the
        “Kore Albani,” known only in copies dated to 440 <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> on the basis of
        comparison with a similar figure in the South Metope XIX of the
        Parthenon: <span class="smcaps">La Rocca</span>*,*
        1985, fig. 6. See also, for this type of face and hairstyle, the
        head from the Athenian Agora (Agora S2354): <span
        class="smcaps">Boardman 1985</span>, fig. 105.

        class="smcaps">Pugliese Carratelli 1983</span>, p.
        164, figs. 139–42. For the hairstyle with *sakkos* and separate
        locks of hair on the forehead, there are also some comparisons in
        red-figured Attic vases, i.e., the female bust that decorates one
        extremity of the *epinetron* (thigh protector worn while weaving) of
        Eretria (425 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>): see
