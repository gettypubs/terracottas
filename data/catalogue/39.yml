    Orange in color (Munsell 7. 5 yr 8/6); white ground and polychromy as on
    the previous piece. Polychromy: organic pink (vertical decoration along
    the proper right side of the chiton); iron-based red pigment on the hair
    and feet, with minor traces in the mouth.
  :condition: >
    Broken and repaired with some terracotta abrasion. The tip of the pinky
    finger on the left hand is missing; the middle, ring, and pinky fingers
    of the right hand have been broken and reattached. The figure retains a
    heavy layer of burial accretion and modern overpaint, which covers the
    white ground.

    The position and weight of the figure are similar to those of the other
    members of this group (cat. 38–41). The coroplast worked on the
    individual pieces, varying the position of the heads and retouching the
    facial features and the drapery. The head is tilted to the right and the
    knee of the bent leg is turned a little more to the left; the eyebrows
    are arched to a greater degree, forming two furrows in the middle of the
    forehead; the upper lip is fleshier, and the expression of grief is more
    marked. Incised on the lower hem of the himation on the proper left side
    is the letter *alpha*.
