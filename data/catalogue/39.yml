    Orange in color (Munsell 7. 5 yr 8/6); white ground and polychromy as on cat. 38 (../38/). Polychromy: organic pink (vertical decoration along the proper right side of the chiton); iron-based red pigment (on the hair and feet, with minor traces in the mouth).
  :condition: >
    Broken and repaired with some terracotta abrasion. The tip of the pinky finger on the left hand is missing; the middle, ring, and pinky fingers of the right hand have been broken and reattached. The figure retains a heavy layer of burial accretion and modern overpaint, which covers the white ground.

    The position and weight of the figure are similar to those of the other members of this group ([cats. 38](../38), [39](../39/), [40](../40/), and [41](../41)). The coroplast worked on the individual pieces, varying the position of the heads and retouching the facial features and the drapery. The head is tilted to the right, and the knee of the bent leg is turned a little more to the left; the eyebrows are arched to a greater degree, forming two furrows in the middle of the forehead; the upper lip is fleshier, and the expression of grief is more marked. Incised on the lower hem of the himation on the proper left side is the letter *alpha*.
