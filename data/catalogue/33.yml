    The figure is missing the hands and the left ear covering, and there is a gap in the right side of the cloak; the surface is worn. The cloak has been restored in an inappropriate manner: the left edge partially covers the area where the ear covering once rested.

  :description: |2
    The character is depicted in a crouching position. The head is inclined
    to the proper left, the arms are extending forward, and the hands may
    have held a weapon (a sword or an axe). The figure wears an enveloping
    tunic that extends down to its feet, which is fastened in the front by a
    broad band with a raised edge; it wears a fluttering short cape about
    its shoulders; on its head is a Phrygian cap with broad earflaps, from
    which curly locks of hair and a spherical earring emerge. In the back
    there is a small, oval-shaped hole; the body and the head were made with
    bivalve molds; the arms and the feet were added to the figure before
    firing.[^1]

    The statuette must originally have been correlated with another figure
    and probably formed part of the plastic decoration of an Apulian or
    Canosan vase; such vases were often adorned with groups of warriors in
    motion.[^2] As to the iconography, the Eastern headdress links this
    figure to the typology of the Amazon, depicted in motion as she is about
    to deal a blow with her weapon. The theme of Amazons in combat enjoyed
    great popularity in southern Italy during the Hellenistic period, and it
    is documented in a variety of materials, with special diffusion of the
    theme in funerary contexts. Amazons are generally depicted in vigorous
    movement that either raises their clothing or uncovers their breasts
    and in situations of combat with Greek warriors, though there are very
    few comparisons for this particular crouching scheme. Although Amazons
    are more commonly depicted with a short chiton, the long tunic with a
    central sash beneath the breasts points in any case to an Eastern
    context.[^3] Often confused with the Arimasps, legendary Eastern
    warriors who were mostly depicted fighting griffins and with whom they
    shared numerous iconographic characteristics, the Amazons presented
    signs of femininity and differentiation, which in some cases
    consisted solely of ornaments such as earrings and bracelets.[^4] The
    iconography of the Amazons first began to take on funerary significance
    in Asia Minor and was introduced to Taras in the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, forming part of the
    iconographic repertory of funerary monument decoration.[^5] The
    statuette may generically be assigned to the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>

    #### Notes

    [^1]: Before the Getty acquired it, this statuette had been identified
        as a fisherman and mounted on an inappropriate trapezoidal base
        ([71.AD.138.2](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/131422/unknown-maker-base-of-a-statuette-greek-south-italian-tarantine-3rd-2nd-century-bc/)), a procedure that is not uncommon in artifacts
        intended for the antiquities trade.

    [^2]: The crouching position can also be found in figures decorating the vases of Canosa; see, for instance, the *epichysis* (wine pitcher) from the Lagrasta I hypogeum of Canosa depicting a female figure on her knees, with a cape puffing out over her shoulders, datable from the third century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, in R. Cassano, “Gli ipogei Lagrasta,” in <span class="smcaps">Cassano</span> 1992*,* p. 214, fig.6.

The dynamism of the figures and the soft movement of the drapery is a distinctive characteristic of the Tarentine sculpture of the third and fourth centuries <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>
