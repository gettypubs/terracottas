    Beige in color (Munsell 7.5 yr 8/3–8/4), very hard and compact, with many
    small reflective inclusions; extensive traces of polychromy over a layer
    of white slip; brownish red (hair), pink (complexion).

    Incrustations, white in color and calcareous, especially on the right side
    of the back section. The internal surface of the two holes on either side
    of the head is abraded, probably due to the original presence of metal
    elements.
  :provenance: |
    * Thomas Virzì, Italian, 1881–1974 (Munich, Germany)[^1];
    * By 1994–1996, Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman (New York, New York), donated
      to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1996.

    The mask presents a rounded skullcap and two holes for hanging in the
    upper section of the head. The general characteristics suggest that it
    is associated with the New Comedy character *Colax*, an adulator (vain
    flatterer), described by Pollux and also documented in the corpus of
    theatrical masks of Lipari in five separate examples. This character has
    a malevolent, ambiguous smile, an oval face with puffy cheeks, a strong
    jaw, and a long, thin nose. The convex forehead features a cleft in the
    central area and a frontal eminence above that. The eyes are half closed
    with the upper eyelids partially lowered; the eyebrows are raised in an
    arching curve; the mouth is broad and wide open, with fleshy lips; the
    chin is full, with a dimple. The hair, painted red, forms a crown of
    radial striations around the forehead, with a raised section in the
    middle. The *Colax* masks from Lipari, found in stratigraphic contexts
    associated with vases in the style of Gnathia and of the Lipari Painter,
    can be dated to the first half of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>.[^1] Hypothetically, the
    *Colax* mask might be attributable to the Apulian area and, though there
    is no direct comparison with other Tarentine masks, it can be placed in
    the larger repertory of theatrical terracottas that characterize the
    local production and the funerary votive deposits of the third century
    <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2]
