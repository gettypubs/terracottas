    Light beige in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/4), porous and friable, with small
    and intermittent reflective inclusions; in a number of points, the fabric
    presents an orange color (Munsell 5 yr 7/8), with calcareous inclusions.
    The polychromy has been preserved in a number of areas, laid over a layer
    of white slip: pink (wings), purple (hair, complexion, and animal fur), and
    black (sections of background). The front part was made with a simple mold;
    the back part, not modeled, features a circular vent hole. The wings and
    tail were applied to the figure before firing; a number of details, such
    as the deer’s rear hoof, were retouched by hand.
  :condition: |
    Partially reassembled from numerous fragments; there are many gaps in both
    the back and the front sections.

  :description: |2

    The little Eros is resting its weight on its bent left leg while its
    right leg is extended to one side; with both arms it embraces the neck
    of a deer, which rests its muzzle on the Eros’s left cheek. The Eros’s
    head is tilted slightly while its shoulders are turned toward the
    animal. The face is plump; the eyes are round with indications of
    pupils; the mouth is fleshy; the hair cascades down onto the shoulders
    in wavy locks and is woven into a braid from the center of the forehead
    backward. The Eros is dressed only in a chlamys fastened on the right
    shoulder with a circular clasp; his feet are shod with sandals. The
    Eros’s wings are spread. The front of the fat body is naked and folds of
    flesh are indicated on the inner thighs and abdomen. The figures are set
    upon a low, hollow, parallelepiped-shaped base.

    The child Eros is found throughout coroplastic production in southern
    Italy mostly from the second half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> It was probably derived from
    Greek models and adapted for the needs of local worship.[^1] The type
    covered only with a chlamys, which is quite common, is accompanied by
    attributes that allude to the multiplicity of functions that the figure
    of the Eros could perform. When found accompanied by an animal in South
    Italy, this type is primarily associated with funerary deposits, as is
    the case in Taranto and Metaponto.[^2] The subject can also take on
    other meanings in connection with the sphere of Aphrodite, mystery and
    Dionysian cults, or rites of passage from childhood to youth. In the
    absence of a specific context, however, these references must remain
    merely speculative.[^3]

    The type can be dated between the end of the fourth century and the
    first half of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> on the basis of stylistic
    comparisons with statuettes originating from datable contexts. Although
    a Sicilian findspot has been proposed, the type also has affinities with
    Tarentine pieces.[^4]

        to the image, see <span class="smcaps">Hermary and
        Cassimatis</span> 1986, pp. 939–41*.*

    [^2]: In terracotta figurines, Eros is more commonly accompanied by
        piglets, dolphins, or birds. For the association of Eros with
        cervids, see <span class="smcaps">Hermary and
        Cassimatis</span> 1986, pp. 872–73. For the type of an Eros
        embracing the neck of an animal, see <span

        228–231, figs. 216, 218, 261; in this funerary context, Erotes with
        kitharae and amphorae can be associated with other statuettes that
        have links to the Dionysian sphere, such as maenads<span
