  :description: |2

    The face is elongated, and the brow is furrowed with an especially
    pronounced crease in the middle; the eyes are small with thickened
    eyelids; the nose is turned downward, the small mouth is sunken between
    the mustache and beard, and the lower lip is fleshy. The wavy hair is
    treated in separate locks marked by a series of pronounced striations,
    forming three bands in the center of the forehead and falling in an
    orderly fashion on either side, leaving the ears uncovered. The beard is
    long, with dense, linear locks; the attachment of the beard to the face
    is marked. Atop the head is set a convivial wreath that was originally
    decorated with floral elements.

    This head, representing a banqueter, can be linked to a well-known
    Tarentine typology present in numerous examples in Taranto and in many
    museum collections. In particular, the head is directly comparable, in
    the type of hair and the definition of the furrowed brow, with Tarentine
    examples now in the Basel Antikenmuseum: a head of the same size, but
    without a wreath, and a bust, both datable to the third quarter of the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1]
    This type of bearded banqueter seems to be derived from the Boeotian
    masks of Dionysos dating from the second half of the fifth century BC,
    especially in view of the rendering of the lower part of the face, with
    the projecting lip and the beard with pronounced striations bespeaking
    an archaizing inflection.[^2]
