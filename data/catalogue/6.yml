  :description: |2
    The young man’s head is set on a bull neck. The face is squarish, the
    facial features are marked, the cheeks are full, the eyes are large and
    asymmetrical, the nose is broad, and the mouth, with its sharply drawn
    and fleshy lips, is half-open. The curly hair is rendered rather
    carelessly in small clumps arranged in an arc across the forehead,
    leaving the large ears uncovered; the ears are characterized by swollen
    auricles. On the nape of the neck and on the occiput, the hair is left
    unfinished.

    Given the tight, snug head of hair and the mouth with fleshy lips, this
    type might well depict an African, but the large ears are reminiscent of
    an athlete and, more specifically, a boxer, since such ears were
    considered characteristic of those who practiced this sport. Sports
    enjoyed a long tradition in Taras and, together with Metapontion
    (Metaponto) and Lokris, the Laconian colony had won numerous victories
    at Olympia. As a result of the ties established between athleticism and
    the philosophical culture of Magna Graecia, images of athletes and
    athletic contests had become preferred iconographic motifs in
    vase-painting as far back as the sixth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1]

    The image of an athlete within a cult precinct that may have belonged to
    the necropolis, as for example at Satyrion, might be a reference to the
    social and political function attributed to the offerer or the deceased.

    The childish appearance of this face and a number of formal elements
    hark back to the heads of young athletes in the Severe style, such as a
    marble head from the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, a Roman copy after a
    Severe-style prototype with close-cut hair, large eyes with thick
    eyelids, and the heavy overall structure.[^2] A marble male head from
    Taranto, datable to the end of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> and probably of the local
    school, though influenced by Attic production, presents similar
    characteristics in the fleshy face and the hair rendered in globular
    clumps on the sides; the shape of the thick eyelids and the full face,
    reminiscent of the Getty head, are characteristics found in other
    Tarentine heads from the Early Hellenistic period.[^3]
