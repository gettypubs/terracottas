  :description: |2
    The head is set on a powerful neck that is slightly tapered and marked
    by two Venus rings. The face is oval; the forehead is high; the eyes are
    asymmetrical, set on two different planes, and slightly sunken. The
    eyelids are thick and the outer corners are twisted downward. The lips
    are fleshy, the chin is full and rounded with a dimple at the beginning
    of the lower lip; the nose is straight with a flattened ridge. The hair,
    parted in the middle, is arranged in long, parallel, serpentine locks
    with sharp ridges; it puffs out on either side of the face and is
    gathered in a roll behind the neck, leaving the earlobes uncovered. In
    the middle of the hair is a flattened triangular space, suggesting that
    a diadem may have been inserted there. On the nape of the neck, the hair
    is depicted with wavy, parallel incisions. The ears are pierced for the
    insertion of earrings. The chin is quite pronounced. On the left side of
    the nape of the neck, there is a small hole.[^1]

    The head shows considerable stylistic and iconographic affinities with
    the head at [cat. 10](10), especially in the rendering of the hairstyle and
    the general treatment of the facial features, though the workmanship is
    less precise and the hair shows a looser style in front. Like the
    previous head, this type can be compared with the Sicilian busts which
    in Magna Graecia were modified in keeping with local stylistic
    preferences and preserved, in some cases, the frontal appearance and
    features from Classical models. All the same, the absence of the *polos*
    and comparison with the types of banqueters could link the bust to the
    image of an offerer or a deceased woman.[^2] This hairstyle with linear,
    serpentine locks, the eyes with raised-band eyelids, and the sinuous
    line of the mouth characterize many fictile Tarentine heads from the
    first half of the fifth century through the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3]

    A very close comparison, in terms of both the hairstyle and the
    rendering of facial features, can be made with a number of female heads
    probably belonging to statues originally from Saturo. Comparison can be
    made with another head, smaller in format, seen alongside a reclining
    figure and dating to the middle of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC,</span> and with a female head
    antefix from the sanctuary of Persephone in Contrada Mannella at Locri,
    dating to the middle of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^4] Tarentine influence
    seems evident as well in the seated female figure in a terracotta slab
    that decorated the interior of a chamber tomb in Centuripe in the third
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, which is
    similar to the Getty head in its hairstyle and in the facial features
    that bespeak a Classical model.[^5] This hairstyle is also found in a
    soft-stone head that can be dated between the last quarter of the fourth
    century and the first quarter of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, which attests to the
    presence of a single stylistic approach among both coroplasts and
    sculptors.[^6] These comparisons suggest the dating of this type to
    approximately the middle of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>

    #### Notes

    [^1]: This hole is ancient and was made in the wet or pre-fired clay. A
        number of busts from Morgantina feature a small hole on the neck,
        probably intended for the insertion of ornaments. See <span
        class="smcaps">Bell 1981</span>, no. 116.

        70–71. For the hairstyle, see the comparable female head in
