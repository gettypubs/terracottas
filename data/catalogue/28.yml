    This figure, hunched slightly forward, is seated upon a stool;
    originally the arms were extended forward. She wears a chiton beneath
    which it is easy to make out the sagging breasts and the belly. The very
    large head has pronounced, roughly modeled facial features that
    caricature the elderly female character. The hair is brushed in an arch
    over the forehead and raised in the middle, pulled back into a sort of
    *sakkos* that culminates in a broad bow. The mouth is large with
    half-open swollen lips twisted into a mocking smile; the eyes are
    elongated with upper eyelids exaggerated in order to convey the idea of
    swelling. The nose is broad, the eyebrows are furrowed, and the forehead
    is marked by two deep creases. She wears sandals on her feet, and there
    are small holes on either the side of the head.

    Statuettes depicting seated old women can fit into the repertory of
    comic-theater types, in which the comic force sprang precisely from an
    emphasis on physical decay. Figures are often accompanied by wineskins
    or skyphoi*,* evident allusions to the motif of the drunken old woman,
    which is one of the best known iconographies in the category of genre
    subjects.[^1] In some cases, statuettes of old women are depicted
    holding babies or children, and in such cases they can more readily be
    identified as elderly nurses; in this kourotrophic context, the figures
    act as symbolic objects intended to protect the life of a young
    child.[^2] The type features no characterizing attributes, save perhaps
    for the accentuation of physical decay and the mocking expression, which
    are found also in the types of elderly *hetairai*;[^3] it therefore
    seems more likely that this is a genre figure assignable to the context
    of the rich production of Magna Graecia and Sicily, dating from the
    fourth and third centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, and oriented toward comic
    themes.[^4]

    At Lipari, statuettes depicting elderly female slaves or housekeepers
    have been identified by Bernabò Brea as Middle Comedy characters, while
    various mask typologies have been found in funerary deposits of the late
    fourth century and the first half of the third century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> Some of these are
    characterized by mouths with only two surviving teeth.[^5] Figures of
    elderly seated women are also present in Sicily in funerary deposits
    from the second century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>
    in Centuripe. The type has significant correspondences in Taranto where,
    among the five seated women found in funerary deposits that can be dated
    to the period from the first quarter of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span> to the first quarter of the
    second century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, none of
    them is holding a child, while some have folded arms. Here, too, the
    custom of placing statuettes of theatrical subjects in tombs must have
    had a link to the cult of Dionysos, which is intimately related with the
    funerary world and with an eschatological vision of the afterlife.[^6]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: On the theme of the drunken old woman, see P. Zanker, *Die
        Trunkene Alte: Das Lachen der Verhöhnten* (Frankfurt am Main, 1989);
        see also the relationship between the coroplastic art and “fine art”
        in connection with a statuette from Montagna di Marzo, see C. Greco,
        “Una terracotta da Montagna di Marzo e il tema della ‘vecchia
        ubriaca’,” in *Alessandria e il mondo ellenistico-romano*: *Studi in
        onore di Achille Adriani* (Rome, 1983–84), pp. 686–94.

    [^2]: A figure of an elderly nurse sitting with a child in her arms,
        possibly from Attica, dates from after the middle of the fourth
        century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> and is
        thought to depict one of the first types created in Athens; see
        <span class="smcaps">Uhlenbrock</span> 1990, no.
        15, p. 122. For examples from Tanagra, see <span

        particular, for another statuette in the Getty collection (inv.
        73.AD.53, said to be from Sicily), identified by Pfisterer-Haas as a
        *hetaira* and dated to the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>, see fig. 100, no.
        III.35, pp. 59 and 134*.*

        funerary deposits of various contexts, as for example Centuripe; see

        XXXIII, and <span class="smcaps">Libertini</span>
