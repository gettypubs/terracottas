    Hazelnut brown in color (Munsell 5 yr 8/4), with a delicate and porous
    consistency and small reflective inclusions. The polychromy applied over
    a white slip is well preserved: purple (hair and base), pink (skin), white
    (himation, rocky base, and part of the kithara), and light blue (hem of
    the himation, leaves of the wreath, and lower part of the kithara).
  :condition: >
    Worn surface, various scratches, especially on the back of the figure.
    Several elements are missing, including a number of leaves of the wreath,
    the upper part of the instrument, and part of the *plektron*. There are
    small gaps in the back part and white accretions and black stains overall.

  :description: |2

    The figure stands on an irregularly shaped base. The body’s weight rests
    on the right leg, while the left leg is bent, with the left foot resting
    on a projection that resembles a low rocky relief. The head is turned
    toward the left; the belly is plump, with the linea alba defined. The
    facial features are delicate and drawn in a soft chiaroscuro, giving the
    face a vaguely pathetic aspect; the long hair, parted in the center, is
    arranged in wavy locks, with two long ringlets draped onto the chest; in
    the back, the hair is gathered in a soft ponytail. A wreath with pointed
    leaves crowns the head. The ample himation is draped over the figure’s
    left shoulder, leaving the torso and right shoulder bare, then rolled up
    on the hips, falling to the left in ample, thick folds. The feet are
    shod with high sandals. The kithara, held in the left hand, leans
    against the left shoulder. The right arm is bent and extended forward;
    the right hand, resting against the belly, holds the *plektron*.

    The statuette depicts a crowned god with a kithara, probably Apollo or
    Dionysos, as the crown with triangular leaves seems to suggest. This
    subject was extensively portrayed in Magna Graecia and in Sicily in both
    vase-paintings and the coroplastic art. The type of Apollo with kithara,
    created in sculpture of the Classical age, was variously interpreted in
    the Hellenistic age. Particularly in the first half of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, the
    iconography of Apollo became the subject of new depictions, influenced
    by the statuary, which tended to emphasize the image of the musician and
    inspiring god. Apollo shared various iconographic affinities with the
    Dionysos as well, such as the hairstyle, the crown of ivy leaves, and
    the himation draped around the legs.[^1]

    The iconography of Dionysos holding a lyre or kithara occurs rather
    infrequently and only at the end of the fifth century BC. It is
    represented, for example, in the Apulian context in a small group of
    red-figured vases decorated by the White Saccos Painter in the first
    half of the fourth century BC, probably reflecting a new tendency in
    Greek religion and an iconographic syncretism between Apollo and
    Dionysos already evident in the sculpture of Dionysos with kithara in
    the pediment of the Classical temple of Apollo at Delphi (360–320
    BC).[^2]

    Depictions of Apollo standing nude or partially clothed with a foot
    resting on a rocky elevation were preferred in the Hellenistic period
    for the unstable rhythm of the pose, which gave greater dynamism and
    sharper tension in accordance with the new concept of the figure.

    Some distinctive features, such as the cloak wrapping around the legs,
    the free left leg, the kithara held on the left side with the arm raised
    to the head—as in the Apollo Lykaios by Praxiteles—and the long hair
    drawn back also characterize the Apollo Kitharoidos sculpted by
    Timarchides in 180 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>. It
    is known in various copies, the most complete of which is the so-called
    Apollo of Cyrene.[^3] However, this type was extensively modified in its
    many variants with the introduction of other elements, some of which
    appear in this statuette, such as the position of the right arm, bent
    forward with the *plektron* in hand.[^4] In stylistic terms, this figure
    emphasizes Praxitelean influences, as evident for example in the Apollo
    Lykaios, upon which this statuette seems vaguely to be modeled,
    especially in the flexing position of the body, the soft, full nude
    figure, and the feminine hairstyle.[^5]

    The Getty statuette can be assigned to the production of Canosa in the
    second century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>; there
    is a very close parallel in another statuette, probably made from the
    same molds, now in a Swiss private collection, and also likely
    originating in Canosa.[^6] The type of the Apollo Kitharoidos is well
    documented in coroplastic art, with numerous eclectic variants, from
    other centers in Magna Graecia and Sicily—in Taranto, Egnazia, Caulonia,
    Paestum, and Centuripe.[^7] The popularity of the Apollo Kitharoidos
    iconography in Magna Graecia is also documented as early as the
    Classical period on a stater from Metaponto dating from 430 <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span> It shows Apollo seated,
    looking right, and intently playing a large kithara.[^8]

    A number of statuettes of Apollo standing with kithara and *plektron*
    were also found among the deposits in the Campetti sanctuary at Veii,
    which are dated to the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^9] At Myrina in Asia Minor,
    the type is well attested and fits into the more common production of
    Hellenistic coroplastic art, documenting an intense circulation of
    typologies and iconographies between eastern and western workshops.[^10]
    This Apollo is shown with the so-called Italiote kithara, which is well
    documented in the decorative repertory of South Italian vase-painting as
    early as 360 <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^11]
    Characterized by a long rectangular shape, this instrument has narrow,
    straight vertical arms, a rectangular soundbox, and small disks at the
    ends of the arms. The number of strings can vary from five to nine. This
    instrument is also often associated with objects that symbolize
    matrimonial rites, and it appears in a symposium scene painted in a
    Macedonian chamber tomb.[^12]

    #### Appendix

    The work was manufactured in three principal parts, each pushed into an
    open piece mold consisting of the body and head, three-quarters of the
    right arm, and the base. The body was formed by joining the front and
    back of the figure, indicated by the seams up both sides that join at
    the crown of the head. The right arm was manufactured separately, and
    seams are visible at the bicep and the hand. The figure is hollow but
    does not have a hollow underside; rather it has a separately made base.
    In clay and handling, the base is consistent with the body and right arm
    and continues the details and profile of the figure on its exterior. On
    the underside, there is a preserved swirl, which appears to have been
    rendered with the tip of a finger while the clay was still wet.

    Normally the bottom would have been left open as a ventilation hole to
    prevent potential expansion or explosion during firing. However, because
    of the clay used, the continuous figural profile, and the lack of
    fracturing or any signs of later addition, it is apparent that the base
    with preserved swirl is original to the piece.

    Structurally, the piece is sound but shows evidence that the head had
    been broken off and the figure broken in two at the waist. Both areas
    show plaster fills with overpaint, apparent in visible and ultraviolet
    light. After examination under a microscope and sample analysis with PLM
    and XRF, the extent of overpainting was found to be confined to the
    plaster fills, and none of the coloration of the figure had been
    refreshed or renewed.
