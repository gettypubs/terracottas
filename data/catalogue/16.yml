    The head, which belonged to a bust or a statue, features an elongated
    oval face with lowered superciliary arches. The eyes are asymmetrical,
    and the eyelids are lowered; the upper rims of the eyelids in particular
    are notably thickened. The nose is straight, and the mouth is small and
    slightly open, with a fleshy lower lip. The hair pushes out from beneath
    the *sakkos*, which has a button on top marked by a raised edge along
    the forehead; the hair is arranged alongside the face in puffy locks,
    rendered by means of deep incisions. The figure wears spherical globular
    earrings.

    This piece is comparable to a bust of a banqueter from the votive
    deposit of the Via Di Palma in Taranto dating to the second half of the
    fifth century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1] In
    particular, the stylization of the locks of hair and the sharply lined
    eyelids are recurring elements in the Tarentine coroplastic art, as are
    the lowered gaze and the expression of melancholy found in local plastic
    art from the end of the fifth century to the first half of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] The
    spherical earrings are quite common, as is the *sakkos* with a high
    edge, which is found on some heads of statues found in the *favissae* of
    Saturo.[^3]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: See <span class="smcaps">Iacobone 1988</span>, p. 93, pls. 89a–b, pertaining to a male bust and attesting to a
        workshop practice that allowed artisans to adapt a single type of
        head to both male and female figures; see also <span
        class="smcaps">Besques 1954</span>, pl. XCIV,
        C362, from the end of the fifth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>.

        Lambrinoudakis, *LIMC* 2 (1984), s.v. “Apollon,”
        dating to the mid-fifth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> See also the male bronze
        statuette in P. Kranz, “Ein Zeugnis lokrischer Toreutik im Cleveland

        no. 1, and 107, no. 1, especially for the rendering of the locks of
        hair around the forehead, the structure of face, and facial
        features; also <span

        BC in <span class="smcaps">Herdejürgen 1982</span>, pp. 48–49, no. 107. For the marked eyebrows, see ibid., no.

        420–400 <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, possibly
        from Taranto, in U. Gehrig, *Antiken aus Berliner Privatbesitz*,

        rendering of the hairstyle, compare also [cats. 9](../9/) and [10](../10/) in this
        catalogue, as well as the head, probably from Taranto and dating
        from the same chronological range, in C. Vermeule*, Greek, Etruscan
        and Roman Art: The Classical Collections of the Museum of Fine Arts*
        (Boston, 1963), fig. 11.

        54, 56, 58, 60. A head with *sakkos* with hair emerging more freely
        from the headgear comes from Favissa 6 in Saturo (crate 1299).
