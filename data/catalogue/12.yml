    This female head has a broad, full face; the eyes are small and
    almond-shaped with thick eyelids; the nose is straight; the mouth has
    fleshy, barely open lips; the chin is rounded. The hair is combed into
    short, fine, curly locks at the sides of the face, leaving the ears
    uncovered; the locks appear to be held by a ribbon whose ends fall in
    the middle of the forehead. On the head and at the nape of the neck, the
    hair, parted in the middle, is treated summarily in wavy locks that are
    rendered through light incisions. The figure wears lunate earrings
    interrupted in the middle by a knurled thread. This type of head,
    thought not especially widespread, is present in the Tarentine
    coroplastic repertory of the Early Hellenistic period. Heads of
    statuettes from the Via di Palma votive deposit, datable to the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC,</span> show the same
    broad facial structure and the hairstyle consisting of short, curly
    locks framing the forehead; this type is also found in the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> in busts of
    banqueters.[^1] The type of “lunate” earrings, with two vertical
    elements set midway along the crescent, is well attested in Taranto and
    can be found in the funerary deposits from the second half of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: The head from Via Di Palma, see <span
        class="smcaps">Iacobone</span> 1988, p. 34, pl.
        26c, generally dated to the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> A similar head comes
        from Saturo (crate 713).

        ‘Imitation’ Jewellery,” *BABesch* 57 (1982), pp. 192–99, no. 5, fig.
        6. In general, on the typologies of earrings recurrent in Taras
        during the Hellenistic period, see T. Schojer, “Orecchini,” in <span
