    The female head has regular features and is turned slightly to the
    right. The oval yet full face has a rounded chin, understated
    cheekbones, lowered superciliary arches, and small, asymmetrical,
    almond-shaped eyes with clearly defined eyelids. The nose is small and
    the fleshy neck is marked at its proper right side by a wrinkle made by
    the slightly tipped head. The low forehead is framed by hair gathered in
    two wavy bands and combed softly toward the occiput, with two ringlets
    falling alongside the neck, leaving the ears uncovered. The figure wears
    disk-shaped earrings. At the back of the head, the hair, parted in the
    middle, is combed into horizontal and parallel waves rendered by quickly
    executed incisions. On the nape of the neck, there is a circular hole.

    The softness of the shaping and rendering, the slight turn of the head,
    the barely parted lips, the way the eyes are sunk into the orbital
    cavities, and the prominence of the superciliary arches, which emphasize
    the intensity of the gaze and accentuate the pictorial surface values,
    all place this head in the context of Tarentine sculpture of Praxitelean
    inspiration.[^1] In particular, one terracotta female head, now in
    Kassel. dated from the beginning of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC</span>, presents similar
    characteristics, such as the hairstyle with two curls dropping down
    alongside the neck and the regular, nuanced facial features with sunken
    eyes with a rim of shadow just beneath the eyebrows.[^2] The rounded
    strands of hair form loose waves from a central part down to the
    temples, with curls falling along either side of the neck. They also
    recur in a mold in the Getty Museum (inv. 74.AD.54 reproducing a female
    head signed “LY,” referring perhaps to a Tarentine coroplast active in
    the middle and third quarter of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^3] This may also be
    compared with another head from Taranto in Basel, which has a similar
    hairstyle but is in a frontal position and is characterized by a harsher
    expression. For the treatment of the hairstyle and the coloristic
    rendering of the locks, a comparison can also be made with a bust of a
    seated female figure in Basel datable to the second quarter of the
    fourth century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> period
    in which the Getty head might be dated<span
    class="smcaps">.</span>[^4]

    #### Notes

    [^1]: For comparable facial features, see the marble female head dating
        to the end of the fourth to the beginning of the third century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span> in <span
        class="smcaps">Belli Pasqua</span> 1995, p. 78,
        vol. 4, no. 8, and the head at [cat. 14](14). On the disk earrings found
        in numerous variants in Taranto, and often associated with a
        pendant, see T. Schojer, “Orecchini,” in <span
        class="smcaps">De Juliis</span> 1984, pp. 129–46,
        referring to the second type.

    [^2]: See U. Sinn, Antike Terrakotten (Kassel, 1977), no. 47, with
        previous bibliography, and <span
        class="smcaps">Iacobone</span> 1988, p. 149, pl.
        137a, for a head of Praxitelean inspiration, datable to the second
        half of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC.</span> A certain stylistic
        resemblance is also notable in the hairstyle of the head in the
        Musei Civici di Trieste, Poli 2010, cat. 534, p. 269, before the
        middle of the fourth century <span
        class="smcaps">BC</span>

        no. A.1, figs. 1 and 5 (incorrectly cited as 74.AD.22). Thirty-one
        other examples of Tarentine molds are in the Getty collection,
        together with seven molds generally identified as South Italian. See
        infra, “Guide to the Collection of South Italian and Sicilian
        Terracottas.”
