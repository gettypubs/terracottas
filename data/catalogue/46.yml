    A hazelnut brown color (Munsell 7.5 yr 8/6), porous, with numerous
    reflective inclusions. Thick white slip with polychrome pigments preserved
    in a number of places: pink (upper section of the wings, complexion),
    black (hair and eyes), light blue (edge and lower part of the wings),
    white (wreath), and red (lips and straps). Made with bivalve molds.
  :condition: |2
    The right hand, <em>plektron</em>, and part of the wreath are missing;
    there are several large chip losses on the left wing, light surface
    accretions, and black stains overall, probably of biological origin. The
    right arm has been reattached; there are three repaired breaks on the fret
    boards of the instrument. The surface under the wing has been abraded by
    the metal mount. The head is slightly larger than that of cat. 45, and it
    is crowned with a wreath of leaves and fruit; the lyre has been preserved
    intact. The straps cross over the chest and run around the attachment
    points of the thighs; red bands can be seen on the calves.[^1]
