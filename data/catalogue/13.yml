  :description: |2

    The head is set on a flared neck; the hair is arranged on either side of
    the face in flame-shaped locks defined by deep incisions; beneath the
    nape of the neck it is rendered with thick strips of clay worked by hand
    and applied before firing.

    The face is broad, the outer edges of the eyes are turned downward, and
    the eyebrows are contiguous with the upper eyelid. The nose is broad at
    the base and the mouth is elongated and fleshy, very roughly finished,
    and apparently twisted in a grimace. On the head is a *sakkos*; the ears
    are adorned with a pair of spherical earrings. The head echoes, in part,
    the characteristics of the head at cat. 21, especially in the hairstyle
    and the shape of the eyes, but this head is less carefully modeled and
    the facial features are more roughly executed.

    The type of hairstyle—pulled back and covered by a *sakkos*—can be found
    in a number of Tarentine heads from the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^1] The mouth and the
    especially broad-based nose are found in the terracotta head of a deity
    from Taranto dating to the first half of the fourth century <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] The snakelike locks of
    hair with sharp-edged ridges, partially covering the ears, can also be
    found in marble sculpture as early as the beginning of the fourth
    century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, as is attested
    by a female head in which the influence of the Attic post-Phidian style
    has been recognized.[^3]
