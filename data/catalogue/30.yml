    Light beige in color (Munsell 10 yr 8/2–8/3), porous. Polychromy: pink (face), light blue and turquoise (leaves of the
    wreath), purple (hair), violet (himation and chiton), and white (clothing
    and face), on white
    slip (white lead). Head and body were made with two bivalve molds; the back features
    an oval vent hole; there is a small hole where the statuette would have
    attached to a base.
  :condition: >
    The statuette has no supporting base and is missing its left foot. Also
    missing are a number of ornaments from the wreath. There are losses in the
    paint and ground layer overall and small chip losses in the leaves of the
    headdress and the bottom of the drapery. There is a modern hole drilled in
    the bottom (possibly for diagnostic testing); there are some root marks on
    the back surface and grayish accretions in many places, especially around
    the neck, the back of the shoulders, and the lower part of the drapery on
    both sides. There is a dark reddish brown stain-accretion on the left hip.

    to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1996.

  :description: |2
    The female dancer has a petite, elongated physique. Her left arm is bent
    and resting on the hip, while the right arm holds the folds of the
    himation in front as she makes a subtle dance step, in which the left
    leg extends in front of the right; her lowered head turns toward the
    right. The long chiton extends to the feet, the himation wraps softly
    around the figure, and a hem held back by the left hand falls to one
    side in zigzagging folds. Following the movement of the figure, the
    garments form a series of fluttering folds at the feet. The face has
    delicate features with large spherical earrings, and the head features a
    melon-style hairdo, with a round bun on the top of the head and a wreath
    decorated with ivy and two small, round pieces of fruit.[^1]

    The statuette can be assigned, both through typology and clay, to the
    Tarentine milieu. The type of female dancer articulated in space
    probably originated in Attica at the beginning of the fourth century
    <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^2] It spread into the
    Tanagra repertory, recurring in South Italy and especially in Tarentine
    funerary deposits of the third century and the first quarter of the
    second century <span class="smcaps">BC</span>, when
    there was a notable recovery in Taranto of funerary coroplastic
    production with an enriched iconographic repertory and improved
    technical quality.[^3] A number of Tarentine statuettes present a
    similar iconographic scheme and stylistic characteristics, including the
    elongated torso and the dynamism of the figure, similar to the type of
    the late third-century <span class="smcaps">BC</span> bronze statuette in the Metropolitan Museum of
    Art known as the Baker Dancer, in which elements
    of Alexandrian style have been recognized.[^4]

    The Getty dancer shows a clear Dionysian character, to which the ivy
    wreath also points; Dionysian elements played a dominant role in the
    Tarentine funerary iconography of the fourth and third centuries <span
    class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^5] Further evidence of the
    popularity of the type in the coroplastic production comes from Sicily,
    particularly in a number of examples of female dancers from Morgantina,
    Syracuse, Cefalù, and Monte Saraceno, generally dating from the third
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^6]

    Female dancers are well attested in the Hellenistic period**,**
    including among the votive deposits of the sanctuaries of Demeter.
    Corinth, for instance, is the source of a number of examples datable
    between the end of the fourth century and the beginning of the third
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span> These show a
    number of recurring characteristics, such as the left arm on the hip;
    the drapery that entirely envelops the figure, forming fluttering folds
    in motion; and a foreshortened composition.[^7] Figures of female
    dancers that are very similar to this one, characterized by a rich
    movement of the drapery—which is reminiscent of the stylistic signature
    of some Hellenistic sculptors—have also been found in Priene, Pergamon,
    and Troy, where they would continue to be produced until the first
    century <span class="smcaps">BC.</span>[^8]

    <span class="smcaps">Appendix:</span> The statuette was examined under polarized light microscopy (PLM) and
    XRF. The blue was identified as Egyptian blue and the
    white as white lead. There is no indication of modern repainting.

        quotidiana,” in <span class="smcaps">Pugliese
        Carratelli 1988</span>, pp. 285–326, esp. fig. 353 (on the

        Nazionale of Taranto, dating from the third century <span

        veiled female dancer; see <span
